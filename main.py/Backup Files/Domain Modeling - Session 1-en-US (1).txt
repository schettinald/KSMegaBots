00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:00.660
Yeah.

d764374b-99b5-441c-a9cf-1579459fae92-0
00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.147
Thanks, Andrew. Sorry, I meant
to have you do that at the

d764374b-99b5-441c-a9cf-1579459fae92-1
00:00:08.147 --> 00:00:11.120
beginning. I didn't say anything
that big yet, that major yet.

8b96b8c8-1983-4421-bfd1-48b6ff0444c2-0
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.750
Umm.

07a43b34-1b36-4821-abf0-4eccfbb86985-0
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.829
The domain modeling comes out of
a domain driven design. So it is

07a43b34-1b36-4821-abf0-4eccfbb86985-1
00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:21.337
a part of software development
where we make sure that

07a43b34-1b36-4821-abf0-4eccfbb86985-2
00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:25.228
everybody on the team, whether
it is business or development

07a43b34-1b36-4821-abf0-4eccfbb86985-3
00:00:25.228 --> 00:00:29.119
has understanding of all of the
processes and then the rules

07a43b34-1b36-4821-abf0-4eccfbb86985-4
00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.201
that make up the domain. So when
we talk about entities, we are

07a43b34-1b36-4821-abf0-4eccfbb86985-5
00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:36.900
talking again nouns and the
relationships that are formed

07a43b34-1b36-4821-abf0-4eccfbb86985-6
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.090
between them, how are they
related to each other.

0829f075-c36a-4f10-8b8a-a1b6938fd740-0
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.091
A client has a trade, a trader
is partner to that trade, that

0829f075-c36a-4f10-8b8a-a1b6938fd740-1
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:48.982
kind of thing, and you'll see as
we go through here how these

0829f075-c36a-4f10-8b8a-a1b6938fd740-2
00:00:48.982 --> 00:00:50.740
things relate to each other.

dde940d3-3cfb-4a22-bffb-d5867f5a5e0a-0
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.130
One of the things that it is
not.

2c32f71b-42cb-44c0-952d-5f5afb32becf-0
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.100
It is not a database model.

ce22945f-aba4-4f0c-92f2-a5904c79e3fd-0
00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.993
All of the conversations that
we're going to have today are

ce22945f-aba4-4f0c-92f2-a5904c79e3fd-1
00:01:00.993 --> 00:01:03.840
going to focus around the
business that you're in. We

ce22945f-aba4-4f0c-92f2-a5904c79e3fd-2
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.634
won't have technology
conversations. We're not going

ce22945f-aba4-4f0c-92f2-a5904c79e3fd-3
00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:09.691
to talk about how this is going
to build, be built. We're

ce22945f-aba4-4f0c-92f2-a5904c79e3fd-4
00:01:09.691 --> 00:01:12.644
strictly going to be talking
about the business and the

ce22945f-aba4-4f0c-92f2-a5904c79e3fd-5
00:01:12.644 --> 00:01:15.543
processes. From a business
perspective, they will look

ce22945f-aba4-4f0c-92f2-a5904c79e3fd-6
00:01:15.543 --> 00:01:16.440
somewhat similar.

e5540d3a-c2e8-4344-a360-8301ec816e6d-0
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.337
And the domain model will
eventually be extended to go

e5540d3a-c2e8-4344-a360-8301ec816e6d-1
00:01:21.337 --> 00:01:24.480
into more of an ERD a
relationship diagram.

be1a4b79-60c9-4dd6-83f2-d5d356673153-0
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.686
And hopefully when a database is
built it will look similar to

be1a4b79-60c9-4dd6-83f2-d5d356673153-1
00:01:29.686 --> 00:01:33.260
what the domain model is, but
they are not the same thing.

d5cdef16-a1d3-4907-9996-33eb5d999f5a-0
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.805
So, Michael, don't get freaked
out that you're going to have to

d5cdef16-a1d3-4907-9996-33eb5d999f5a-1
00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:38.610
know a lot of technology speak
you're not.

3b571d0d-2ada-4ce7-ac18-5eefca5768e9-0
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.804
Scott, take off your technology
hat for a little bit and think

3b571d0d-2ada-4ce7-ac18-5eefca5768e9-1
00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:47.085
strictly business, that's all
we're going to be talking about

3b571d0d-2ada-4ce7-ac18-5eefca5768e9-2
00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:50.155
are aren't going to go down.
He's got databases. Awesome.

3b571d0d-2ada-4ce7-ac18-5eefca5768e9-3
00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:53.224
That'll come in really handy
later, but our engineers are

3b571d0d-2ada-4ce7-ac18-5eefca5768e9-4
00:01:53.224 --> 00:01:55.870
going to take off their
technology hats and we're

3b571d0d-2ada-4ce7-ac18-5eefca5768e9-5
00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.569
strictly going to talk on the
business side today.

2881e3b6-21cc-4d9f-961b-92a760b31aac-0
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.460
OK.

60946093-a02a-478a-952d-d9cd2ad125ab-0
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.160
Kevin, you're on mute.

9ff0c962-a583-432b-aa0f-7c187da2b39b-0
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.150
Yeah, I just realized that,
Michael, this is a bit for you.

9ff0c962-a583-432b-aa0f-7c187da2b39b-1
00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.542
So the domain driven design is,
is, is not just like something

9ff0c962-a583-432b-aa0f-7c187da2b39b-2
00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:14.042
we invented, right? It's a, it's
a thing. And so you're going to

9ff0c962-a583-432b-aa0f-7c187da2b39b-3
00:02:14.042 --> 00:02:17.326
start off and you're like how
does the hippo and connect the

9ff0c962-a583-432b-aa0f-7c187da2b39b-4
00:02:17.326 --> 00:02:20.611
leg bone? And we're going to
talk about what is a client and

9ff0c962-a583-432b-aa0f-7c187da2b39b-5
00:02:20.611 --> 00:02:24.056
what is a broker and you're just
think, this is so silly in the

9ff0c962-a583-432b-aa0f-7c187da2b39b-6
00:02:24.056 --> 00:02:27.610
beginning, but by the end of the
session, I think you're going to

9ff0c962-a583-432b-aa0f-7c187da2b39b-7
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.056
find it. There's some complexity
that really gets into here and

9ff0c962-a583-432b-aa0f-7c187da2b39b-8
00:02:31.056 --> 00:02:34.286
this is complexity we should
figure out now because when we

9ff0c962-a583-432b-aa0f-7c187da2b39b-9
00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:34.609
start.

1a1f883a-a140-4e9e-8b4a-a8698aa7dec8-0
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.005
Coding and building things it's
so much easier to figure out

1a1f883a-a140-4e9e-8b4a-a8698aa7dec8-1
00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:41.222
now. For example, like a a
broker could belong to multiple

1a1f883a-a140-4e9e-8b4a-a8698aa7dec8-2
00:02:41.222 --> 00:02:41.550
desks.

622dbbc9-9b8c-41b7-8450-d7f31b818ad0-0
00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.822
Yeah, yeah. You don't have to
tell me this. I'm already bought

622dbbc9-9b8c-41b7-8450-d7f31b818ad0-1
00:02:45.822 --> 00:02:45.990
in.

0e966383-c2a4-4a28-a534-342a813802f2-0
00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.841
BeyoncÃ© pages is the way to go,
right? Yeah, because oftentimes

0e966383-c2a4-4a28-a534-342a813802f2-1
00:02:50.841 --> 00:02:53.974
our, especially our business
clients like, yeah, this is so

0e966383-c2a4-4a28-a534-342a813802f2-2
00:02:53.974 --> 00:02:57.159
silly, like, this is so simple
to, but once you get into it,

0e966383-c2a4-4a28-a534-342a813802f2-3
00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:00.188
you'll find that the domain
model we build is going to be

0e966383-c2a4-4a28-a534-342a813802f2-4
00:03:00.188 --> 00:03:03.060
the most important diagram we
use for the entire year.

da75c5db-79f0-4000-85ee-95e75473444b-0
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.232
Yep. And that is I, I know Mike
has got you understand why we're

da75c5db-79f0-4000-85ee-95e75473444b-1
00:03:08.232 --> 00:03:11.954
doing this. That's why I'm going
through these fairly quickly. I

da75c5db-79f0-4000-85ee-95e75473444b-2
00:03:11.954 --> 00:03:15.333
just want to be sure that I
share them with you afterwards

da75c5db-79f0-4000-85ee-95e75473444b-3
00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:18.769
so you can read a little bit
more around why we're doing it

da75c5db-79f0-4000-85ee-95e75473444b-4
00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:22.090
and some of the history behind
it. I'm going to skip just

da75c5db-79f0-4000-85ee-95e75473444b-5
00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.526
really quickly over here, the
debate modeling sessions held

da75c5db-79f0-4000-85ee-95e75473444b-6
00:03:25.526 --> 00:03:29.134
early and often. I will tell you
that you will see this domain

da75c5db-79f0-4000-85ee-95e75473444b-7
00:03:29.134 --> 00:03:31.940
model come back at you
frequently. Anytime we're

da75c5db-79f0-4000-85ee-95e75473444b-8
00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.460
building something we want to be
sure that.

30c44799-ee38-4d3a-af74-8c708b32ca56-0
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.584
It's something that we have
talked about and it fills fits

30c44799-ee38-4d3a-af74-8c708b32ca56-1
00:03:38.584 --> 00:03:42.454
into the domain model. Or if we
come back later and try to add

30c44799-ee38-4d3a-af74-8c708b32ca56-2
00:03:42.454 --> 00:03:46.325
something in, does it work with
the model that we've built? If

30c44799-ee38-4d3a-af74-8c708b32ca56-3
00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:50.011
not, how much rework do we have
to do? What happens in this

30c44799-ee38-4d3a-af74-8c708b32ca56-4
00:03:50.011 --> 00:03:53.943
particular scenario to the model
that we have already built and

30c44799-ee38-4d3a-af74-8c708b32ca56-5
00:03:53.943 --> 00:03:57.813
do we have to make modifications
for that? OK, right now we're

30c44799-ee38-4d3a-af74-8c708b32ca56-6
00:03:57.813 --> 00:04:01.192
just trying to get in this
initial session. We're just

30c44799-ee38-4d3a-af74-8c708b32ca56-7
00:04:01.192 --> 00:04:04.079
trying to get really an
understanding of basic

30c44799-ee38-4d3a-af74-8c708b32ca56-8
00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.800
understanding of what it is.

f25e2d4c-b120-4eb5-8072-f2e13d5098e0-0
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.768
You want to get us all on the
same page, but then we will

f25e2d4c-b120-4eb5-8072-f2e13d5098e0-1
00:04:09.768 --> 00:04:14.090
revisit it on a regular basis to
make sure that any new scenario,

f25e2d4c-b120-4eb5-8072-f2e13d5098e0-2
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.215
any new functionality that comes
along, fits within the domain

f25e2d4c-b120-4eb5-8072-f2e13d5098e0-3
00:04:18.215 --> 00:04:21.490
model that we've built, it will
extend it if not.

8d7a5309-7661-4ac8-b80e-57d65fb4062d-0
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:25.423
We may have some, and this is
where the refactoring word

8d7a5309-7661-4ac8-b80e-57d65fb4062d-1
00:04:25.423 --> 00:04:28.962
always comes along, but we're
going to build it as robust now

8d7a5309-7661-4ac8-b80e-57d65fb4062d-2
00:04:28.962 --> 00:04:31.360
as we can to minimize that in
the future.

2689909b-f0c4-4bf5-bdad-dffc250dc038-0
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:33.750


d96e8c95-8f92-4fcf-b0c4-77f3438391b5-0
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:39.160
And then last thing I'll touch
on. We know that we have.

054195f1-08ea-4a6d-8910-a00be37456d0-0
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.607
Really been successful in
building the model when everyone

054195f1-08ea-4a6d-8910-a00be37456d0-1
00:04:43.607 --> 00:04:44.530
understands it.

102d87e0-cb52-465e-ba83-98a80d296e45-0
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.990
When we can take any of your
scenarios and walk through the

102d87e0-cb52-465e-ba83-98a80d296e45-1
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.940
scenario and it makes sense on
that domain model.

c69fae3c-c895-47dd-a832-fa57c93f4da8-0
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.923
We don't have to be technical to
understand it. It's understood

c69fae3c-c895-47dd-a832-fa57c93f4da8-1
00:04:56.923 --> 00:05:00.194
by both sides of the equation,
both the business and the

c69fae3c-c895-47dd-a832-fa57c93f4da8-2
00:05:00.194 --> 00:05:01.170
technology folks.

f9794811-6e23-4016-9806-5f09f92189ac-0
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.173
And it kind of makes sense. It
makes sense on the whole. It

f9794811-6e23-4016-9806-5f09f92189ac-1
00:05:05.173 --> 00:05:08.493
feels right. It feels good when
we look at it. You can't poke

f9794811-6e23-4016-9806-5f09f92189ac-2
00:05:08.493 --> 00:05:09.350
any holes in it.

75ba5560-cc88-4f1f-93d8-5fa460ecc0dd-0
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.160
Put that in there.

2ee3aa51-874c-49c6-9370-bb57865485a9-0
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.690
Yes.

5d9d18dc-4cad-4fce-8b37-a3616040750d-0
00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.910
You should be able to explain it
to anybody.

30948081-1e33-4033-b785-bb2e8ca423a5-0
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.775
So if someone were to come in
after we build this, someone

30948081-1e33-4033-b785-bb2e8ca423a5-1
00:05:24.775 --> 00:05:27.707
were to come in and not have an
understanding of Stagg

30948081-1e33-4033-b785-bb2e8ca423a5-2
00:05:27.707 --> 00:05:31.013
securities and what it is we're
trying to build, we should be

30948081-1e33-4033-b785-bb2e8ca423a5-3
00:05:31.013 --> 00:05:34.159
able to walk them through the
domain model and they should

30948081-1e33-4033-b785-bb2e8ca423a5-4
00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.304
have a good understanding of
what it is we're trying to do

30948081-1e33-4033-b785-bb2e8ca423a5-5
00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:40.716
without having a lot of subject
matter expertise. If not, we've

30948081-1e33-4033-b785-bb2e8ca423a5-6
00:05:40.716 --> 00:05:41.570
missed the mark.

82e0f8ea-215f-49c6-a494-fd35d6fc6724-0
00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:44.110
I'm.

6c53e53e-00e1-4352-b16b-51c211ae0375-0
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.726
So based on that what I did and
I wasn't in the overviews, I

6c53e53e-00e1-4352-b16b-51c211ae0375-1
00:05:49.726 --> 00:05:53.781
wasn't able to make it because
of a conflict, but I did listen

6c53e53e-00e1-4352-b16b-51c211ae0375-2
00:05:53.781 --> 00:05:57.901
to the recordings and thank you
very much for recording them. I

6c53e53e-00e1-4352-b16b-51c211ae0375-3
00:05:57.901 --> 00:06:02.149
did listen to the recordings and
then yesterday's session as well

6c53e53e-00e1-4352-b16b-51c211ae0375-4
00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:06.076
and based on that information
put together last night a very

6c53e53e-00e1-4352-b16b-51c211ae0375-5
00:06:06.076 --> 00:06:09.810
high level domain model based on
what you have currently.

79a928a0-c2e9-4ff7-aa27-9f39f4f3ad05-0
00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.703
Just to kind of give you an
example. And then of course I

79a928a0-c2e9-4ff7-aa27-9f39f4f3ad05-1
00:06:13.703 --> 00:06:16.810
had the folks on our side take a
look at it this morning to make

79a928a0-c2e9-4ff7-aa27-9f39f4f3ad05-2
00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:18.580
sure that I wasn't totally off
base.

cefb6d25-4874-481e-a1e5-764dd67044eb-0
00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.234
They told me I was a little bit
crazy, but not totally. So I'm

cefb6d25-4874-481e-a1e5-764dd67044eb-1
00:06:23.234 --> 00:06:26.528
going to share that with you now
just to kind of give you an idea

cefb6d25-4874-481e-a1e5-764dd67044eb-2
00:06:26.528 --> 00:06:29.723
of what one of these looks like.
We're going to walk through it

cefb6d25-4874-481e-a1e5-764dd67044eb-3
00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.518
and then you're going to start
doing the talking on the

cefb6d25-4874-481e-a1e5-764dd67044eb-4
00:06:32.518 --> 00:06:35.363
customer facing or the new
applications that don't exist

cefb6d25-4874-481e-a1e5-764dd67044eb-5
00:06:35.363 --> 00:06:37.560
yet so we can extend the model,
make sense?

bf024bc4-1121-40b1-8192-0f187d4719a6-0
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.070
OK, if I was totally off base,
you could tell me that too.

fe5e5c9a-b0e3-4976-8699-d8d11d0c02b7-0
00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.667
But hopefully it wasn't too far
off base or we weren't too far

fe5e5c9a-b0e3-4976-8699-d8d11d0c02b7-1
00:06:46.667 --> 00:06:49.360
off base because I wasn't the
only one that worked on this.

ce33ff6c-0c03-4f83-b91a-c780497782a5-0
00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.200
OK.

3e871a6e-0288-4762-a57c-3790a20250de-0
00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.320
Am I zoomed in enough?

9d6bb530-8657-49c0-a3c7-2fadc7c9bafa-0
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.250
Maybe a little too much.

9afa68d2-82c7-4e90-b568-8bd97491a5ff-0
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.057
They can scroll back and forth,
I just wanna be sure you can

9afa68d2-82c7-4e90-b568-8bd97491a5ff-1
00:07:02.057 --> 00:07:02.340
read it.

33c14a70-5d8b-41f5-b1b1-f5ccdb3c5b2a-0
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.160
Ohh yeah I can read it.

81fe8d6c-37b1-4867-a0aa-5d7326719811-0
00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.256
OK, the whole thing, but I can
read it. Yep, I'll scroll back

81fe8d6c-37b1-4867-a0aa-5d7326719811-1
00:07:08.256 --> 00:07:11.472
and forth as we go. So I'm going
to start kind of in the middle

81fe8d6c-37b1-4867-a0aa-5d7326719811-2
00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:12.930
here with our trade progress.

7cba6231-a4db-485c-b6e1-185a630c2999-0
00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.350
I'm sorry, Sabrina, did you say
something?

1eb584f3-f651-45fb-8e54-a04c8cdaa066-0
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:21.306
Oh, OK, I thought I heard a
comment. OK, I'm going to start

1eb584f3-f651-45fb-8e54-a04c8cdaa066-1
00:07:21.306 --> 00:07:23.904
here in the middle in the tray
with a trade and just kind of

1eb584f3-f651-45fb-8e54-a04c8cdaa066-2
00:07:23.904 --> 00:07:26.120
walk through and these are the
things that I heard.

5b94bbf3-e426-4f3b-b421-fc10e53ef99d-0
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.120
As I went through the
recordings.

d2c3964d-75f2-413b-bd80-928b7d1a36ec-0
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.924
There may be things that need to
change, updates that we need to

d2c3964d-75f2-413b-bd80-928b7d1a36ec-1
00:07:33.924 --> 00:07:37.605
make, etcetera, but starting
here and this is where Kevin

d2c3964d-75f2-413b-bd80-928b7d1a36ec-2
00:07:37.605 --> 00:07:41.032
will start to chime in as
needed. But our trade has a

d2c3964d-75f2-413b-bd80-928b7d1a36ec-3
00:07:41.032 --> 00:07:44.839
broker. It has no more than two
traders associated with it.

eb12967b-6014-4619-970e-33ba40342515-0
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.330
Our broker works on many client
accounts.

9076a863-b05d-4035-bc19-d8c82b5a16eb-0
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:51.550
We also have our client in here.

1f4235f9-1a10-4ba3-a133-4840f2bed1aa-0
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.868
Our client has many traders and
our client has many client

1f4235f9-1a10-4ba3-a133-4840f2bed1aa-1
00:07:55.868 --> 00:07:56.420
accounts.

d7082e03-d4cb-4563-84cb-b0258554363d-0
00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:01.290
We heard two different types of
traders. There's buyers and

d7082e03-d4cb-4563-84cb-b0258554363d-1
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.300
seller trader types.

9b7f2f1b-6a13-4c5b-b544-55c9a93408d0-0
00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.960
That trader has at least one
desk membership.

9e2eb9b2-efbf-4db3-b1ac-a3d852b3b8eb-0
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:10.730
The broker also has at least one
desk membership.

cda3660f-8326-422e-a024-9b46fd2408e3-0
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:15.884
Because our client has desks and
those desks we had different

cda3660f-8326-422e-a024-9b46fd2408e3-1
00:08:15.884 --> 00:08:19.913
types of desks. Like, I can't
remember the two examples that

cda3660f-8326-422e-a024-9b46fd2408e3-2
00:08:19.913 --> 00:08:21.300
you gave a soft desk.

5f92c0e3-6fa1-4b40-bc9c-e07f563af349-0
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.593
Scott, you gave a couple of
different examples in there as

5f92c0e3-6fa1-4b40-bc9c-e07f563af349-1
00:08:25.593 --> 00:08:29.100
we were going soft sand grains
is probably what I said you gave

5f92c0e3-6fa1-4b40-bc9c-e07f563af349-2
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.950
grains is another one. The desk
also had an e-mail.

49e047ce-1166-432b-b3c5-0799d2813cb8-0
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.419
Where they wanted to get
information about the recaps,

49e047ce-1166-432b-b3c5-0799d2813cb8-1
00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:38.200
any failures, things like that.

6303d247-ee01-4120-9691-3f64787f24f3-0
00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:43.070
The desk does have many products
that are associated with it.

201a1192-c813-44f2-ae76-079a629f04aa-0
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.171
We also have trades. Those
trades are for the specific

201a1192-c813-44f2-ae76-079a629f04aa-1
00:08:47.171 --> 00:08:47.710
products.

e834ad7c-e562-4dac-a6ab-af8e9136b95b-0
00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:52.811
OK, the trade can generate at
least one e-mail, and those

e834ad7c-e562-4dac-a6ab-af8e9136b95b-1
00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:55.710
emails are for the recaps and
the failures.

b3499a20-a8fb-4887-846a-52bd5b61807d-0
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.568
I'm going to pause there just
along this section here. Did we

b3499a20-a8fb-4887-846a-52bd5b61807d-1
00:09:02.568 --> 00:09:04.850
capture it so far and does it
make sense?

a16326ee-6764-4956-a6e7-2165ca948004-0
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.600
How nitpicky do you want me to
be on this?

ff71dd9e-ee07-4729-be89-3d16175906ae-0
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.310
You know it's got either.

5e515f03-ea69-463c-9e42-6caae20ffb7b-0
00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:13.810
Have a question, Scott?

34abca34-ff4a-4674-a77d-91117e271a59-0
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.791
Go for it if you want to be
very, very nitpicky. OK, so

34abca34-ff4a-4674-a77d-91117e271a59-1
00:09:19.791 --> 00:09:20.690
first thing.

0411745c-9f0f-4d28-bc9d-50b09cd2784c-0
00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:26.170
A client desk and an internal
desk are not the same thing.

9ae00389-939d-47d6-95a0-33e8ed9095df-0
00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:29.540
They sort of got different
attributes associated with it.

14751d76-079f-4ec5-87cc-c5c0b04cb867-0
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:34.953
So I don't see a like an
internal desk or a broker desk

14751d76-079f-4ec5-87cc-c5c0b04cb867-1
00:09:34.953 --> 00:09:35.560
anywhere.

de81a3da-1778-4fa6-9351-5e28ae4cee61-0
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.750
We probably need that.

9b474648-3714-4aa3-85d6-e824ecd50a9f-0
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.020
Agreed. Client desk and broker
desk.

d4de78ce-662a-4fb4-b706-051464adc730-0
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.130
Probably like that.

e3ffc13e-4a4d-40fd-935d-ae71abee5e34-0
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:02.140
Yep.

7c04d5ea-ed0c-4a3f-a2c2-1ad822b03bae-0
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.454
And I will warn you, as I'm
editing this, the lines are

7c04d5ea-ed0c-4a3f-a2c2-1ad822b03bae-1
00:10:06.454 --> 00:10:08.910
going to get ugly. They'll go
pretty again when we get done.

3427b5cf-f725-4701-a848-c2eb76f7c245-0
00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:15.600
So I'd probably introduce.

24fd9e56-e7d8-478f-b1f8-de222ead48ef-0
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.610
Another entity related to trade
called an instrument.

646aaadf-4fe5-4785-a8e4-755efa5459b5-0
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:22.920
Umm.

14887932-ebad-460a-bbab-45d8d1520c74-0
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.770
So an instrument is like a
single.

ebba22f5-ddcf-430b-b61d-8a5037037878-0
00:10:29.010 --> 00:10:29.660
Umm.

e1b7ab52-deed-4ec0-b86b-2fdf723fcad8-0
00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:34.937
Financial instruments, sorry,
but as just as an example like

e1b7ab52-deed-4ec0-b86b-2fdf723fcad8-1
00:10:34.937 --> 00:10:36.660
an option like say the.

a5f024db-b9e7-4d17-91d7-733931b06d5c-0
00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.620
Corn, December.

8bb207e1-7162-4955-9bd5-729a32f879a2-0
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:43.990
1300 call.

d5073acb-f4f4-4ee8-934b-41f1e9208148-0
00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:46.730
Is an instrument.

b6cfe53a-1204-48fd-a5eb-0db86fb7bcb4-0
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:49.970
And then the instrument would
be.

4e949f63-439d-4d85-a2fa-1f02f3fbe982-0
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.890
Part of a product essentially.
So like the product in that case

4e949f63-439d-4d85-a2fa-1f02f3fbe982-1
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.200
would be corn options.

93b36a39-fdd7-46a8-b3b1-bb87dc42638e-0
00:10:57.090 --> 00:11:00.812
The instrument includes some of
the the buying or selling

93b36a39-fdd7-46a8-b3b1-bb87dc42638e-1
00:11:00.812 --> 00:11:02.160
information in there.

73f7921f-079d-4491-b698-877567e42dae-0
00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.190
No, no. Oh, OK.

0f43a6de-d826-4258-b164-274969805e42-0
00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.056
It did. Sorry, it doesn't. The
instrument doesn't include

0f43a6de-d826-4258-b164-274969805e42-1
00:11:10.056 --> 00:11:14.444
whether to buy or sale. It does
include. It has a whole host of

0f43a6de-d826-4258-b164-274969805e42-2
00:11:14.444 --> 00:11:16.570
other attributes or parameters.

541d3215-c13c-42d8-a859-3031698474ca-0
00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:23.113
Comments, OK. Because Scott has
exactly said something like 1300

541d3215-c13c-42d8-a859-3031698474ca-1
00:11:23.113 --> 00:11:27.556
and I assume that was like an
order number that was the strike

541d3215-c13c-42d8-a859-3031698474ca-2
00:11:27.556 --> 00:11:29.320
price of. OK, OK, OK, OK.

ee67630a-271f-4b3d-85e3-c75fe3bee7cc-0
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:33.490
Yeah, Denise, I think financial
instrument will be in between

ee67630a-271f-4b3d-85e3-c75fe3bee7cc-1
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.832
trade and products. You trade a
financial instrument and a

ee67630a-271f-4b3d-85e3-c75fe3bee7cc-2
00:11:35.832 --> 00:11:37.380
financial system is a type of
product.

968717cd-88cf-4770-aa25-498ff917066e-0
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:38.990
No.

9bba58dc-71c4-42d2-9595-8fb8e1f16881-0
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.320
It's not. It's not a type of
product. A product is like a a

9bba58dc-71c4-42d2-9595-8fb8e1f16881-1
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:44.940
grouping.

72e72170-df09-4fa8-af2c-bfe735be67b8-0
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.160
Of similar sets of instruments,
so like the.

ceb6fef1-f783-44fe-a627-6625c85fb72a-0
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.750
Like the?

831f72b7-c09f-49ac-9166-1b34990c49c7-0
00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.050
You know, like the 1300 call,
the 1400 call, the 1500 call.

b39136c3-8d32-47de-abdc-46e99e972f06-0
00:11:58.870 --> 00:12:02.618
1300 put, 1400 put those all
have very similar contract

b39136c3-8d32-47de-abdc-46e99e972f06-1
00:12:02.618 --> 00:12:03.020
terms.

6f2de8f2-e25c-4131-b699-87613cb32f40-0
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.410
So the product is sort of the.

b344a5ab-dd7c-4d55-8374-1e45a6934ee2-0
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:09.420
The grouping of all similar.

2f178117-ebe9-4dee-ac9a-abbc31a68fad-0
00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.690
Similar instruments.

56c7bd6e-1189-4498-9f5c-2fe63a3dee5d-0
00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:14.570
At least in my terminology.

71f594d4-6387-43a4-9650-ba93329eb485-0
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.270
And this stuff gets um.

50baf90f-0489-48f9-883a-2abeac887d1b-0
00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.711
Is not really consistent across
firms, I would say about how

50baf90f-0489-48f9-883a-2abeac887d1b-1
00:12:21.711 --> 00:12:22.610
they use these things.

55065318-9d9f-4839-af93-bf8618164a2b-0
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.940


2bb1c671-64b4-4ea3-ad8a-8d0b2b341985-0
00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:28.343
How would you, I'm sorry, how
would you label the relationship

2bb1c671-64b4-4ea3-ad8a-8d0b2b341985-1
00:12:28.343 --> 00:12:30.180
between the financial instrument
and the product?

5c4adaae-ed69-4175-b7b2-815926dfbe74-0
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:33.900
Uh, the product has many
financial instruments.

f722b3a6-5c9e-407a-8644-2272f9dcf2de-0
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:43.795
But isn't that OK? Isn't that
that the financial instrument is

f722b3a6-5c9e-407a-8644-2272f9dcf2de-1
00:12:43.795 --> 00:12:47.890
like the top of this with all
the branches coming down, right?

f722b3a6-5c9e-407a-8644-2272f9dcf2de-2
00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:52.050
So the product is 1 parameter of
a financial instrument, right?

844aaf96-6dcd-4734-9bee-1177f70d012a-0
00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:57.573
And then the financial
instrument also has a all these

844aaf96-6dcd-4734-9bee-1177f70d012a-1
00:12:57.573 --> 00:13:00.960
other parameters that we keep
that we also attributed to it.

8142b736-491f-4da8-8adb-5c79ac68db97-0
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:03.020
Yeah.

121a624a-29e6-46f3-b921-163b77326836-0
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:09.221
Right. So Denise, I think, I
think what they're saying is

121a624a-29e6-46f3-b921-163b77326836-1
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:11.660
that, you know financial
instrument is probably one of

121a624a-29e6-46f3-b921-163b77326836-2
00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:12.060
the core.

742cd330-b9d5-4c70-a514-355bf480c135-0
00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:18.038
Domain entities, and so it would
a financial instrument might

742cd330-b9d5-4c70-a514-355bf480c135-1
00:13:18.038 --> 00:13:18.660
contain.

4a950045-cc90-4ed6-8ffd-3bfbaf49cbc1-0
00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:20.830
Umm.

cfc6b29f-0408-4ef7-9a99-130b060157ea-0
00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.510
Strike a expiration month.

08987762-d9b9-402d-ac36-b82993d44881-0
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.240
Umm.

492dc720-8289-4fd4-97cd-a7bd8ffac1b9-0
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.590
Exchange.

5762d776-e05f-4422-92f4-08be73183d0c-0
00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:37.440
Yeah, so there's multiple types.
The types are.

4d4d81e8-c338-40eb-b39c-404de7005eab-0
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:42.451
Option option on future, which
we'll usually just say option 4

4d4d81e8-c338-40eb-b39c-404de7005eab-1
00:13:42.451 --> 00:13:45.140
because we don't do equity
options right now.

bb1b33c7-8809-4983-a240-b3703978be98-0
00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:48.660
And future.

095c74be-fd2a-4388-9632-915d1f543e0a-0
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.900
Are they the ones that I have
lined to the product right now?

4afd0262-696a-4bf6-bad9-0ae7a5ff5a7d-0
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:54.390
Yep.

88ae7f24-1e5f-4274-ba29-d4f80acc8dcd-0
00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:57.320
Umm.

5222be59-42e3-45cf-86d2-5da66637f064-0
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:59.110
And then.

1bff3acb-4dee-4db5-8742-5a9e7aca4f2f-0
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.090


db074347-f391-4e3a-ba73-f8d61ef6af36-0
00:14:04.950 --> 00:14:08.296
Yeah. And then sort of the like
the key of those two things a

db074347-f391-4e3a-ba73-f8d61ef6af36-1
00:14:08.296 --> 00:14:08.890
future has.

dcb73822-928d-4eef-8376-875ec4a89752-0
00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:10.360
Umm.

8fc2f500-9c79-4726-aedd-19c95b6a7f26-0
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.670
An exchange.

55e2f750-fce4-4073-a66c-44f30fbe8e12-0
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.340
And.

616ffc0d-6f62-4023-b7f9-0a18b1c48af8-0
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:16.320
Umm.

afa7b5d3-f51e-4265-b0b3-572ca300fc65-0
00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:22.294
Well, so usually the way you
identify these things are

afa7b5d3-f51e-4265-b0b3-572ca300fc65-1
00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:23.700
exchange product code.

c21bed8e-7c24-4c4f-b72d-f9ed5f83278c-0
00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.750
And contract date, that's for
our future.

dc57c39e-31c9-4b99-9884-28b58d847f8d-0
00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.570
However, there are a number of
different product codes.

6b8d35c5-9169-44b4-ab15-60cf7d444726-0
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.930
So.

77a57909-86a7-4a27-9cac-2c712405a4b2-0
00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.510


bdfdd402-91fd-4ac4-8f1a-64e6fa08b827-0
00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:39.970
Usually when you're specifying
it, you have to also specify

bdfdd402-91fd-4ac4-8f1a-64e6fa08b827-1
00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:41.390
what kind of product code you've
given.

13b42ec1-822a-44e9-8ae0-75d7248cf408-0
00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.153
I'm wondering if that's what I
have done here on this product

13b42ec1-822a-44e9-8ae0-75d7248cf408-1
00:14:51.153 --> 00:14:53.420
right here because I have the
product going to the exchange.

05d3df99-c8dd-4b1d-a51e-345ab0f76b7e-0
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:55.610
Umm.

f8198002-b055-4a71-8077-381d6980ceda-0
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:00.890
So.

b204ce84-fbe0-4610-876c-a3e881d78ad4-0
00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:03.920
It's also not not true. Some
products are OTC.

a3b9a4a8-9743-4d84-ab8d-7362b5134acb-0
00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:08.278
So listed products are traded
through an exchange, but OTC

a3b9a4a8-9743-4d84-ab8d-7362b5134acb-1
00:15:08.278 --> 00:15:09.120
products are not.

34c49cb2-84d5-42dd-a4b9-e82264f459c5-0
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.920
Is it fair to say may be traded
through an exchange?

8d3f9556-0983-43da-9b2e-76342601c366-0
00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:14.780
Yeah.

792b61f5-a51e-46d4-b6ca-32e765c29f41-0
00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:21.620
Scott when you talk about.

f07f3d6d-7ef6-41fe-bb68-20b1b84d62f0-0
00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:23.140
Products.

6989a57b-0116-43eb-97ac-4f939b216db9-0
00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.950
Do you differentiate? I'm with
you here, the product being

6989a57b-0116-43eb-97ac-4f939b216db9-1
00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.800
future options, future options
and futures.

379039ca-2fb6-41c1-816c-ed60aeeeeed0-0
00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.725
But where, where do you also
include the underlying, the

379039ca-2fb6-41c1-816c-ed60aeeeeed0-1
00:15:38.725 --> 00:15:42.610
underlying commodity and there's
the commodity groups?

a892e8d0-a10c-463c-a956-6c7f71eba81a-0
00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:44.110
Umm.

8615b68b-5e25-4ca1-a9aa-fee9ab30dd71-0
00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:47.510
Because that's not product,
right?

03c9f735-ab74-47c0-aadd-3b641a89b90e-0
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:51.674
So are you talking about like
the underlying physical

03c9f735-ab74-47c0-aadd-3b641a89b90e-1
00:15:51.674 --> 00:15:54.164
commodity? You're talking about
the future that underlies an

03c9f735-ab74-47c0-aadd-3b641a89b90e-2
00:15:54.164 --> 00:15:54.450
option?

08e4c2d0-0ffb-4979-8358-cccfc6ef106c-0
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.698
Are just the first one the the
commodity that underlines the

08e4c2d0-0ffb-4979-8358-cccfc6ef106c-1
00:15:58.698 --> 00:15:59.900
option or the future?

cc824df8-d330-4855-a5de-777c2536c607-0
00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:05.351
That would be leaving leaving
aside the future option

cc824df8-d330-4855-a5de-777c2536c607-1
00:16:05.351 --> 00:16:06.850
complexity for a minute.

2b563a76-2565-4ab9-84fb-c4f964a37603-0
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:11.140
Yeah, sorry, I'd probably call
that a type of product. We don't

2b563a76-2565-4ab9-84fb-c4f964a37603-1
00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:14.386
currently sort of deal with any
of that, or at least not in a

2b563a76-2565-4ab9-84fb-c4f964a37603-2
00:16:14.386 --> 00:16:16.009
way that's integrated with the.

c265603d-0b19-491b-acfc-9af1ffd05af0-0
00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:18.280
Like the derivatives.

806b83b0-6e50-4930-98df-cfee8846021b-0
00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.020
Part of the system.

a87ecff3-08df-4345-85f0-deb7416b4d38-0
00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:21.450
So like.

f0422f75-2a4d-4dc4-9a45-6ce06f20f783-0
00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:26.930
They've got pretty different
attributes, so like.

31d152e9-bdc9-4fba-8aff-992b7f1211a5-0
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:28.500
Umm.

1f617fa0-58cc-4719-a98e-501070afae02-0
00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:37.074
So with I don't know so you, you
got a corn future like the the

1f617fa0-58cc-4719-a98e-501070afae02-1
00:16:37.074 --> 00:16:40.785
physical property underlying
that is you know corn but in

1f617fa0-58cc-4719-a98e-501070afae02-2
00:16:40.785 --> 00:16:44.559
fact there are many, many
details about what kind of corn.

d49cd155-8822-4388-98eb-b2892fc11491-0
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.900
Passing what kind of
inspections?

91849776-6888-4263-9e3a-644f5c4d4ad8-0
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:49.410


cf820482-eb5b-4536-b4e9-a07f6aa7d50b-0
00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.600
What kind of grade there are?
Like price offsets?

374064af-a991-45de-b9b0-390ca4ccb3c0-0
00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:57.799
For depending on what kind of
exact product you deliver,

374064af-a991-45de-b9b0-390ca4ccb3c0-1
00:16:57.799 --> 00:17:01.660
there's information about where
you're allowed to deliver it.

1477706b-c25a-4911-965a-a037374a7544-0
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:03.810
When you're allowed to deliver
it.

a67fbea9-9810-47c8-97dc-b61b748bd569-0
00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.237
Who covers insurance? Who covers
transportation costs like it's a

a67fbea9-9810-47c8-97dc-b61b748bd569-1
00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:12.764
pretty complicated description
of like, what a physical product

a67fbea9-9810-47c8-97dc-b61b748bd569-2
00:17:12.764 --> 00:17:12.929
is?

b4e62da1-10b8-43ad-b6b6-2e5493d529f4-0
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:18.268
Because like, essentially corn
in Chicago is not really the

b4e62da1-10b8-43ad-b6b6-2e5493d529f4-1
00:17:18.268 --> 00:17:19.740
same thing as corn and.

e7405f8f-c527-4bdc-8fe9-b9bea0a81f72-0
00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:21.930
Nebraska.

39247bc2-5ed3-4857-a411-155cf6b25a8f-0
00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:25.870
Because it costs money to
transfer transport between the

39247bc2-5ed3-4857-a411-155cf6b25a8f-1
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:26.330
two places.

27fb1ad7-ca07-4932-902e-91ce61ab89bf-0
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:32.278
Right. But I'm I'm hearing
products in both of those and so

27fb1ad7-ca07-4932-902e-91ce61ab89bf-1
00:17:32.278 --> 00:17:35.500
I'm just trying to differentiate
product between a financial

27fb1ad7-ca07-4932-902e-91ce61ab89bf-2
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.560
instrument. So it's wrong, wrong
word.

7d4b22c2-dcc0-4382-a847-8e128e343173-0
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.883
I'm trying to differentiate
products being optional future

7d4b22c2-dcc0-4382-a847-8e128e343173-1
00:17:42.883 --> 00:17:45.140
and product being corn, soy,
rice.

1ebfb4de-b4ea-4059-afa3-85ac76f680fd-0
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:48.263
Which we bought should are they
both called products or do we

1ebfb4de-b4ea-4059-afa3-85ac76f680fd-1
00:17:48.263 --> 00:17:49.840
want to differentiate those
terminologies?

8bb359ce-9d84-4f8d-96a1-8fe33f2354dc-0
00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:52.010
Umm.

655f4726-b2fd-4b73-a014-91b6e7a48cae-0
00:17:58.210 --> 00:17:59.740
Because I could see that being
just confusing.

fc2c2ecb-a45e-409e-b52a-795daed69857-0
00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:01.120
Yeah.

98d0f815-9845-4d4a-ba6e-a06734220004-0
00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.530
Um.

91b9977b-cbd4-4636-813f-82d701e882ed-0
00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:10.754
I would honestly be pretty
scared about trying to model

91b9977b-cbd4-4636-813f-82d701e882ed-1
00:18:10.754 --> 00:18:12.070
both of them at the same time.

08251ea8-ac43-4550-968e-895863becbba-0
00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:13.680


6c8ddf68-5526-4c9c-b5d3-69daba879657-0
00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.118
The, I guess like sort of the
the current way we do it is

6c8ddf68-5526-4c9c-b5d3-69daba879657-1
00:18:19.118 --> 00:18:22.902
there's a pretty hard split
between exchange listed products

6c8ddf68-5526-4c9c-b5d3-69daba879657-2
00:18:22.902 --> 00:18:25.880
and OTC products like the
underlying commodity.

6607764a-b6b5-4cba-96de-2f1b0ca31e4c-0
00:18:27.450 --> 00:18:30.120
But I mean, I guess product
might be a good place to put it.

af52f247-e6aa-4613-bdd0-67f4eb2ac625-0
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.506
I don't know, maybe you would
put that as another product

af52f247-e6aa-4613-bdd0-67f4eb2ac625-1
00:18:33.506 --> 00:18:34.820
type, like the physical
commodity?

33f0228a-1e2c-4977-88af-e7c3ecff602d-0
00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:36.860
That's what I would do.

6bec3605-e75a-432d-a214-de6ed62e02e3-0
00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.370
No, Denise, I think it's a new
entity.

02da5c6d-a9a7-4e0a-bf85-013de8edec0d-0
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.655
Underneath the product, that's
what I was saying. I mean that

02da5c6d-a9a7-4e0a-bf85-013de8edec0d-1
00:18:44.655 --> 00:18:47.321
might not be where I want to go,
but that's what I meant as a

02da5c6d-a9a7-4e0a-bf85-013de8edec0d-2
00:18:47.321 --> 00:18:47.879
product type.

f2cc1e26-1303-4965-b848-c7f5d8b26ac0-0
00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.470
Option group is also not a
product type.

b785f04d-4599-4546-a568-32acec2732b7-0
00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:02.082
Yeah, see futures and options on
both of these lists for product

b785f04d-4599-4546-a568-32acec2732b7-1
00:19:02.082 --> 00:19:04.140
and financial instrument, do we
need to?

b70dc969-85fc-422b-bffb-717c1da869d0-0
00:19:05.410 --> 00:19:06.860
They actually exist on both.

6dae1178-0022-4bf7-9641-4678458d4122-0
00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.450
Yeah, so.

108c648b-532b-4b1a-94cb-b3015552b19a-0
00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:14.734
Like the product type of a
product is telling you what

108c648b-532b-4b1a-94cb-b3015552b19a-1
00:19:14.734 --> 00:19:18.786
kinds of financial instruments
might be in that product. So

108c648b-532b-4b1a-94cb-b3015552b19a-2
00:19:18.786 --> 00:19:21.420
like an option product will only
have.

c5d9a463-d627-4ce5-939c-e7c70b32a2e4-0
00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:25.400
Option financial instruments
associated with it. A future

c5d9a463-d627-4ce5-939c-e7c70b32a2e4-1
00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.250
product will will only have
future.

633c9c39-0971-48ca-bcb4-69beadcda069-0
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:29.760
Financial instruments associated
with it.

617ad09e-fff8-4218-b16e-7000d04e3931-0
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:40.036
OK. And a commodity will have
neither or that's correct,

617ad09e-fff8-4218-b16e-7000d04e3931-1
00:19:40.036 --> 00:19:40.760
neither?

9a457c17-1563-4a1a-9eb9-5839982cbafc-0
00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:46.750
You could associate a physical
commodity with a future.

784aa65a-a0d3-44df-b78a-1cac8748fd35-0
00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.410
Um, but.

2966017a-53a8-4f85-8037-21ddc606440f-0
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.580
It's more like a like a class of
things, because there's.

39efdeb5-0ad1-4129-a5ed-f0e1a0a5fabf-0
00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:59.727
Exactly what you mean by
physical commodity is kind of

39efdeb5-0ad1-4129-a5ed-f0e1a0a5fabf-1
00:19:59.727 --> 00:20:00.460
context dependent.

6dcfaf2f-1fc0-4b19-931b-9a7327660b5f-0
00:20:01.430 --> 00:20:01.840
Umm.

51e286ef-911e-44bf-8a1d-e915f21c4ad9-0
00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.870
Sounds like a product, Denise.
Sounds like a product can have.

377e5c2a-5ecf-4a0f-863a-4ed0f31b566b-0
00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.840
Many financial instruments
sounds like it doesn't have to.

da04e35f-0fc8-4b08-9586-4ec9704bbdde-0
00:20:21.940 --> 00:20:25.320
Yeah, probably. OK. There's kind
of a.

732415e4-0031-428c-b9c1-99d6c6475eee-0
00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.393
A little bit of a judgment call
between like what do you call a

732415e4-0031-428c-b9c1-99d6c6475eee-1
00:20:29.393 --> 00:20:31.500
product and what do you call a
financial instrument?

c50c1f2c-2d65-4e95-b37d-e9d8090e676f-0
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:34.090
So like.

d867b5d1-eb52-4989-b6a4-ea9299642b8f-0
00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:38.310
I could see calling like corn.

1da80c64-d036-4ffd-83f7-b06f2465302c-0
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:42.193
Physical commodity. And then
like all the different

1da80c64-d036-4ffd-83f7-b06f2465302c-1
00:20:42.193 --> 00:20:45.100
variations of where do you
deliver it? What grade?

8f1ec821-5a9c-420c-a2b7-ad4faea50261-0
00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:50.880
Insurance parameters,
transportation cost parameters,

8f1ec821-5a9c-420c-a2b7-ad4faea50261-1
00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.345
stuff like that. You could like
sort of different combinations

8f1ec821-5a9c-420c-a2b7-ad4faea50261-2
00:20:54.345 --> 00:20:56.600
of those could be different
instruments.

86dd000a-876a-4dd0-ac04-c1865e6c8f0b-0
00:20:58.630 --> 00:20:59.220
Umm.

0d4f9f71-14f1-4d9a-a865-488511521368-0
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.840
I have not written.

ccd9cbad-6832-4907-a27f-61623d0df7a2-0
00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:03.840
Enough code.

e4aa8b70-c189-474b-8088-9b1ed0a63318-0
00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:07.600
With.

125c8230-8cb9-49df-8733-ffc5d8b821a4-0
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:09.790
Physical.

d5226fda-1cf1-47a4-b0d5-a1932f58eb30-0
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:12.170
Commodities stuff.

8627cfc6-ca3b-4622-8116-0464e012c574-0
00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.603
To have an opinion on whether
that's which way is the right

8627cfc6-ca3b-4622-8116-0464e012c574-1
00:21:15.603 --> 00:21:16.220
way to model it.

e0e329e1-0cfa-4384-8bba-792539122214-0
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.297
The part that I'm struggling
with is in in prior types,

e0e329e1-0cfa-4384-8bba-792539122214-1
00:21:21.297 --> 00:21:24.489
futures, options and physical
commodity. Those aren't mutually

e0e329e1-0cfa-4384-8bba-792539122214-2
00:21:24.489 --> 00:21:25.249
exclusive like.

7c1b4b4a-0c2b-4cc1-9705-86d5790cc70e-0
00:21:25.940 --> 00:21:28.935
The physical commodity is corn.
You have a corn future of corn

7c1b4b4a-0c2b-4cc1-9705-86d5790cc70e-1
00:21:28.935 --> 00:21:31.502
option. There seem to be two
things you would connect

7c1b4b4a-0c2b-4cc1-9705-86d5790cc70e-2
00:21:31.502 --> 00:21:31.930
together.

400e4e93-c33a-4603-8fa4-8686b98edf22-0
00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:34.220
What do you mean?

3cc66591-057c-4afd-8b00-38abca2fdb51-0
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:39.447
In that yellow sticky there it
says product types, futures,

3cc66591-057c-4afd-8b00-38abca2fdb51-1
00:21:39.447 --> 00:21:42.553
options, and and physical
commodity. Those those three

3cc66591-057c-4afd-8b00-38abca2fdb51-2
00:21:42.553 --> 00:21:45.659
things are not mutually
exclusive. It's you. You could

3cc66591-057c-4afd-8b00-38abca2fdb51-3
00:21:45.659 --> 00:21:48.200
have a corn future and a corn
option, right?

4afec64d-fa71-49a6-819e-ddf6ece3d043-0
00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:53.720
Yes, but it won't be the same
one.

8eb59609-10cc-493f-a61e-68ff8b683f41-0
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.583
Like you'll have a the corn
future will be one product and

8eb59609-10cc-493f-a61e-68ff8b683f41-1
00:21:57.583 --> 00:22:00.529
the corn options, sorry, the
corn futures will be one product

8eb59609-10cc-493f-a61e-68ff8b683f41-2
00:22:00.529 --> 00:22:03.000
and the corner options will be a
different product.

81a7c572-dbd8-441d-8984-d1a1c408c30f-0
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.450
They're related in that corn
options deliver corn futures.

e44f6025-28e0-4a96-a3b8-5dcd5ad0a52c-0
00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.480
But they're not the same
product.

895b0144-078d-4ae8-b98e-4468d23aa1cc-0
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:16.740
Deliver physical commodity. It's
like a they are linked they, but

895b0144-078d-4ae8-b98e-4468d23aa1cc-1
00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.020
they are all separate.

418710ff-438e-4bbf-bfc7-a07c15d7d24e-0
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.250
They're separate products and
they're traded separate.

88633dce-666b-4772-b72b-684751f1beed-0
00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:25.309
So what, what if we had a
product type? You have to take

88633dce-666b-4772-b72b-684751f1beed-1
00:22:25.309 --> 00:22:28.589
that current product and call
product type and then have a

88633dce-666b-4772-b72b-684751f1beed-2
00:22:28.589 --> 00:22:29.090
separate.

db3eda41-eefc-426a-bb05-8379554d1b10-0
00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.690
Entity that is physical
commodity and you're you're

db3eda41-eefc-426a-bb05-8379554d1b10-1
00:22:32.690 --> 00:22:34.650
bringing those two things
together.

dc19771f-08b6-44e8-b84e-740d27bf9771-0
00:22:35.410 --> 00:22:39.789
Yeah, what you're missing here
is the physical commodity is the

dc19771f-08b6-44e8-b84e-740d27bf9771-1
00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:44.168
actual movement of corn from 1
entity to the other. Like actual

dc19771f-08b6-44e8-b84e-740d27bf9771-2
00:22:44.168 --> 00:22:46.700
physical corn, the other things
are.

1f9ee40f-c057-4d65-b586-389823a145f2-0
00:22:48.170 --> 00:22:52.128
Financial, uh, sorry, uh,
derivative that is being traded

1f9ee40f-c057-4d65-b586-389823a145f2-1
00:22:52.128 --> 00:22:56.224
with the underlying being that
like physical commodity, but

1f9ee40f-c057-4d65-b586-389823a145f2-2
00:22:56.224 --> 00:22:58.750
they're they're three very
separate.

510c4009-e649-46c1-b573-509cfff83e6d-0
00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:04.043
I mean, so, so you're using a
physical commodity as kind of

510c4009-e649-46c1-b573-509cfff83e6d-1
00:23:04.043 --> 00:23:05.520
like spot rate, like a spot?

f28e59f0-abdb-487d-bfd0-165a922a6352-0
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.010
Yeah, spot purchase. Yeah, sure.

17420e61-ae78-4982-a963-94ee4de7bd0b-0
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.000
So do we want each of these to
be their own entity?

7615f04c-2400-4b0a-84e1-de6fa14a099b-0
00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:18.721
Can can you, at least for my
edification, put spot at a

7615f04c-2400-4b0a-84e1-de6fa14a099b-1
00:23:18.721 --> 00:23:21.590
physical commodity at the input
spot in parentheses?

bb6fca40-ff15-4ec7-9212-6867a9ded020-0
00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:27.758
I think we were saying there is,
hey, I want to buy 100 bushels

bb6fca40-ff15-4ec7-9212-6867a9ded020-1
00:23:27.758 --> 00:23:28.120
of corn.

e30d9088-b865-43c2-8c60-4683859bf9ad-0
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:32.442
Like I don't want it later, I
want it now. I just. I just want

e30d9088-b865-43c2-8c60-4683859bf9ad-1
00:23:32.442 --> 00:23:33.010
to buy it.

904032de-5c5d-4534-9234-b92c51ea921b-0
00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.720
Is that what that line is
supposed to say?

c9727417-1da0-4c54-9370-f875d9d09486-0
00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:42.974
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, no,
because like a a physical trade

c9727417-1da0-4c54-9370-f875d9d09486-1
00:23:42.974 --> 00:23:44.500
that like we did.

fa2ecaea-ce24-4690-b5ca-6b122d31c0cb-0
00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:47.430
Whatever.

fa974f35-7e3e-4836-96a2-e86b97cf7054-0
00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:53.561
A week ago was we're going to
deliver ethanol every second

fa974f35-7e3e-4836-96a2-e86b97cf7054-1
00:23:53.561 --> 00:23:55.840
week for the next four months.

d04f98ed-98d7-41f5-a4cf-8e80b9e2738a-0
00:23:57.050 --> 00:23:59.505
So it's not, it's not saying I'm
going to do it today, it's just

d04f98ed-98d7-41f5-a4cf-8e80b9e2738a-1
00:23:59.505 --> 00:24:01.771
saying we're not going to trade
this on the exchange, we're

d04f98ed-98d7-41f5-a4cf-8e80b9e2738a-2
00:24:01.771 --> 00:24:03.320
going to trade this between two
parties.

588c77c0-4acb-4d2d-8968-11b25ef84045-0
00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:08.583
The venue. The venue is also
important for the physical

588c77c0-4acb-4d2d-8968-11b25ef84045-1
00:24:08.583 --> 00:24:09.590
element of this.

055ca398-4332-4a26-8d7b-30bba845c3c3-0
00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:21.410
Um, so in that case, was that a
series of futures?

a16a6f2d-90f5-4a1e-934f-e068c146a53e-0
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.590
Nope.

e20bb588-6d9b-4e2c-98ec-b78b1ce8e720-0
00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:31.858
OK, I guess we need to get a
little more granular on what

e20bb588-6d9b-4e2c-98ec-b78b1ce8e720-1
00:24:31.858 --> 00:24:36.720
like a future. My definition of
a future is a.

15cb9196-8f64-4c37-afb4-1c9075f2195d-0
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:41.990
Exchange traded instrument.

905609c9-21f8-46f5-961e-06df5ebdf376-0
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:50.086
That delivers on some fixed date
in the future that it's and it's

905609c9-21f8-46f5-961e-06df5ebdf376-1
00:24:50.086 --> 00:24:51.370
a standardized.

5f543ccf-8571-419a-9d87-97f32d8fa9e7-0
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:57.320
To exchange rules, a physical
trade is.

971dd323-d81d-4d3f-a621-cf16194d262d-0
00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:58.990
Umm.

a39755f0-4b43-4eb3-9cd3-5920de8dcd71-0
00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:02.100
Much more.

ef3234e0-2948-489d-8dde-55543805f4cb-0
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:09.233
Variant in the parameters. I
guess it's not fixed to one

ef3234e0-2948-489d-8dde-55543805f4cb-1
00:25:09.233 --> 00:25:10.020
specific.

e2d896a8-f6a4-4d88-83ca-b4a782ff00b4-0
00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:16.131
Set of like, pretty much any.
Any piece of that can change.

e2d896a8-f6a4-4d88-83ca-b4a782ff00b4-1
00:25:16.131 --> 00:25:19.894
Any piece of the instrument can
be negotiated and traded with

e2d896a8-f6a4-4d88-83ca-b4a782ff00b4-2
00:25:19.894 --> 00:25:21.290
these folk, right? Yep.

1acaac47-94a8-4dc8-b499-dc4a4e10a0f9-0
00:25:22.010 --> 00:25:22.390
OK.

dff8d06d-c2ef-495d-8e1b-0e16ba8f8ccb-0
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:31.800
So if if I were to.

75b07212-eb97-48fc-bc63-b89870f6c9ce-0
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:37.230
Model out what I'm hearing I I'm
hearing a commodity.

53ca5e10-2c8c-40d1-9d35-8a4659da2b72-0
00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.420
Being corn, rice, soy, whatever.

ece71a29-4e83-4d5c-a3ca-7a2d60d31a51-0
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:44.730
I'm hearing a product type,
future option, etcetera.

64f9ad84-57a3-4a20-b3ea-2a9847747d5e-0
00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.480
I'm hearing exchange.

ee900b13-60ef-40b5-9a83-0700170e2873-0
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:53.040
Which could be OTC being an
exchange.

64ab9771-dddf-438d-a674-bdef604e581a-0
00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:58.531
So like we have ice, we have
CME, we could put OTC there, but

64ab9771-dddf-438d-a674-bdef604e581a-1
00:25:58.531 --> 00:26:02.737
then a financial instrument is a
combination of all those, right?

64ab9771-dddf-438d-a674-bdef604e581a-2
00:26:02.737 --> 00:26:06.497
It's a combination of this
prototype, this commodity, this

64ab9771-dddf-438d-a674-bdef604e581a-3
00:26:06.497 --> 00:26:09.939
exchange and has a few of its
own attributes, strike,

64ab9771-dddf-438d-a674-bdef604e581a-4
00:26:09.939 --> 00:26:12.169
expiration date, things like
that.

35a19365-1397-4298-95e9-a420b58d8a08-0
00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:16.120
Bring it all together and you
trade that financial instrument.

243cfbc0-ce8f-4ebb-930c-f566d55397ef-0
00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:25.640
How's that land with you? Yeah,
I wouldn't.

6b5c9d4f-f5e7-4a04-bdf1-bbb9e0cf946d-0
00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:31.380
Like, I wouldn't say it has all
of those things, like.

7307b872-609b-4d80-bf40-37f98bf5adc4-0
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:32.590
Umm.

098b858e-c3fd-4347-a77c-0af24b220e32-0
00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:38.608
I mean that sort of. They come
implicitly via the relationship

098b858e-c3fd-4347-a77c-0af24b220e32-1
00:26:38.608 --> 00:26:42.440
to other things, like the option
on corn futures.

bbeadf67-9edf-4070-8ae6-a20bd18c2b4c-0
00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.700
Is not like also a corn future.
It's just a.

625f9ef4-835e-4377-ac3f-b36a19429e84-0
00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:53.345
A financial contract that
includes, as part of its terms,

625f9ef4-835e-4377-ac3f-b36a19429e84-1
00:26:53.345 --> 00:26:55.230
delivery of a corn future.

da757ca3-10f6-4e11-bdf1-22b4c5f13514-0
00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:59.386
The corn future is then also
related to physical corn, in

da757ca3-10f6-4e11-bdf1-22b4c5f13514-1
00:26:59.386 --> 00:27:02.705
that if you hold it long enough,
you'll have to make or take

da757ca3-10f6-4e11-bdf1-22b4c5f13514-2
00:27:02.705 --> 00:27:04.120
delivery of physical corn.

5f33ade2-5716-4401-aa95-f49829ca5ec0-0
00:27:04.660 --> 00:27:05.320


260e0ccd-ae55-49d1-b586-56605bf0dd90-0
00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.744
But there's not like a is a
relationship there. Like a a

260e0ccd-ae55-49d1-b586-56605bf0dd90-1
00:27:09.744 --> 00:27:11.680
corn option is not also corn.

f4cde5b1-4bac-45b2-9e7c-58f7ca7d813f-0
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.170
It's just related to corn.

cad155e4-8de6-486e-966e-017990816bdd-0
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.140
Yeah.

6b619179-3063-4433-ba36-be1c9f704b1b-0
00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.140
Agreed. OK.

3378d40b-721a-4761-a06f-fae8d59aab90-0
00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:23.060
Those aren't all the exchanges,
by the way.

97aa8b19-a4a8-48c4-9d9c-a80934f6b986-0
00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.130
Yeah, but Nymex and.

2273b846-198c-4303-8085-21d0c4ed9d64-0
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:29.840
Yeah, you would have.

152e4007-ad49-4035-84b9-fc102ce54042-0
00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:34.339
So the same those examples on
here. I know that we'll have

152e4007-ad49-4035-84b9-fc102ce54042-1
00:27:34.339 --> 00:27:37.633
others, I just put those as
examples of them on here. You

152e4007-ad49-4035-84b9-fc102ce54042-2
00:27:37.633 --> 00:27:39.450
might want to do exchange group.

3ea29841-385f-43f7-8218-0d88748c25c5-0
00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.230
Which would be CME and ice and
OTC?

fcf155a2-e3d2-44e5-b193-92ad2b5df247-0
00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.740
And then you have exchanges.

8cb9e153-7e67-47d7-bf4e-dc40cddfacee-0
00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.750
Like the the ice.

218d0eb8-8b54-42f6-94ae-f2f489fd4537-0
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:57.210
Exchange group would have ICE
Futures US, ICE Futures EU.

f3416374-73be-49fe-a8f2-998dffc8b185-0
00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:01.440
ICE Futures, London I think.

883a6e52-e349-425b-97eb-bf9bb038d56f-0
00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:05.050
ICE Futures Abu Dhabi.

ef399d7b-299d-42e2-bf66-c8367178fc2a-0
00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:07.300


5ea14269-32b1-4087-93c5-62be5a836046-0
00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.650
There's more, but we don't even
care about it.

a39adc7a-cf6f-4602-9b9b-e29cffaef987-0
00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:19.531
And then the semi group
exchanges are CME, CBOT, Nymex

a39adc7a-cf6f-4602-9b9b-e29cffaef987-1
00:28:19.531 --> 00:28:20.490
and COMEX.

c3ac16d4-9833-4e20-ba76-07ef63ce2840-0
00:28:21.930 --> 00:28:24.859
But leave that back as exchange
and just put one above it as

c3ac16d4-9833-4e20-ba76-07ef63ce2840-1
00:28:24.859 --> 00:28:25.580
exchange group.

7243fed3-08bb-44c0-9573-8c53492e0783-0
00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:29.510


85b46137-6687-4c78-9ff0-ce55bfb57d31-0
00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:42.380
Yeah.

2a25453c-bac6-421c-848d-174004e2fcf4-0
00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:52.430
Belongs to. Oh yeah, yeah, sure.

37e061ed-fea9-4f91-adda-d7fd8c0db574-0
00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:02.730
Can you work on this together?

12ed3dd7-9c7b-421b-bd55-c5fe46944900-0
00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:06.370
We do multitasking.

8567a14a-ab85-4f73-97f8-ebc0db61733b-0
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.820
Yeah, I can see you there, yeah.

b890809b-828e-4467-bd06-f12a482f0485-0
00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.430
So what I'll I'll.

d9a45ab1-cbe0-40aa-8151-c019c2d5b995-0
00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:18.440
I'll work on that. You go next
topic.

07f34d9e-57c2-4397-902f-c246a4e6b56d-0
00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:23.760
On the product, are we?

ed2ecf43-a48a-48b4-9b0f-1551c2321517-0
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:27.379
Wanting to are we still good
with this being product or do we

ed2ecf43-a48a-48b4-9b0f-1551c2321517-1
00:29:27.379 --> 00:29:29.310
want to separate out the
physical commodity?

ba47321c-b41d-4da7-91fb-f03e0fba899d-0
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.710
So I I think it should stay like
that, OK?

298a0e5b-56e9-4fba-a01b-2c05da73ed7a-0
00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.565
So Mike, you would make like a
product like corn and then an

298a0e5b-56e9-4fba-a01b-2c05da73ed7a-1
00:29:51.565 --> 00:29:54.270
instrument within that product
would be like?

0ba0fce4-7743-498d-a7cb-8455e56b6326-0
00:29:56.140 --> 00:30:00.240
Corn in Chicago of the X grade.

5430df07-f583-4c51-8e30-b2b447c57a87-0
00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:01.910
Well, it's like.

ae823084-dc84-4023-b830-a3d770295f2b-0
00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:08.937
It's the way we do it now is
like fuel grade ethanol is our

ae823084-dc84-4023-b830-a3d770295f2b-1
00:30:08.937 --> 00:30:13.610
spot is our is our physical
ethanol like product, right.

db5d6d06-9d97-454c-99ca-140cd368a2ef-0
00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.880
And so then all the other
attributes of it or what make it

db5d6d06-9d97-454c-99ca-140cd368a2ef-1
00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.360
an instrument.

23fe7590-3a48-46e1-b5c8-069052d1cdc6-0
00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.500
Yeah, all right.

d35c9b03-30f5-49fd-a47f-4c723a08537a-0
00:30:23.770 --> 00:30:26.730
So then you might also want
option group in there somewhere.

87545fce-55a7-498b-9f36-1e1c276c0144-0
00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:34.170
Which is something that option
products will belong to.

49cbfd5c-5a32-47a5-8e21-4aa808a8f3a1-0
00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:41.000
OK, because I have that as a
product type previously.

3cda0cbb-17d1-442a-9544-8feb12697c8e-0
00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.659
And that's basically sets of
options that have certain things

3cda0cbb-17d1-442a-9544-8feb12697c8e-1
00:30:51.659 --> 00:30:53.070
in common. So for instance.

d6b2c040-8ed6-41c8-9262-d828937aa604-0
00:30:54.790 --> 00:30:55.290
Umm.

efc763a1-fb8a-4efb-8e13-e0b40f2f03d3-0
00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.870
Put the spin on it, yeah.

07d4b922-0944-4559-b9ba-3f27488a2903-0
00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:01.520
Regular corn options.

2dedb6b1-cda9-4bed-8adc-fdecbeec6b4d-0
00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.492
The regular corn options and the
weekly corn options are

2dedb6b1-cda9-4bed-8adc-fdecbeec6b4d-1
00:31:05.492 --> 00:31:06.470
different products.

15945d15-df4b-437c-b4e1-6119355b896e-0
00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:10.089
But they're in the same option
group because they deliver the

15945d15-df4b-437c-b4e1-6119355b896e-1
00:31:10.089 --> 00:31:10.710
same futures.

2aed3c77-1176-46ea-8553-29b2d1673747-0
00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.390
Future product.

49719039-d170-45ea-811f-b34f3cfe1194-0
00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.160
I'm not sure how I made that
spin, but.

fff1ccfa-d826-44df-9075-835613cf7285-0
00:31:24.350 --> 00:31:26.000
We'll keep that in our back
pocket for later.

729da257-9743-4143-b486-0b8f53798caa-0
00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:32.660
OK.

a24ddab3-8fb7-4e38-af75-e54e94ad8cbe-0
00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:35.450
Um.

24f9d645-4fc3-460b-8195-90eae69556bf-0
00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:49.200
I think that's pretty decent for
the.

59651a28-7e7a-453f-a071-fea0adbe2441-0
00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:54.088
Exchange group, exchange option
Group products, financial

59651a28-7e7a-453f-a071-fea0adbe2441-1
00:31:54.088 --> 00:31:55.280
instrument cluster.

26fc1de2-d48d-4345-bc03-e524d622ba13-0
00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.630
If we want to do like those
properties, they're strike

26fc1de2-d48d-4345-bc03-e524d622ba13-1
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:59.680
multiplier, quote multiplier.

5fa7cc11-0330-4082-9d71-5b678633e6f3-0
00:32:00.630 --> 00:32:02.270
There's going to be a whole
freaking mess of them.

a94a4dc5-754b-40f5-80a1-b43ad0318894-0
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:08.721
Well, even just, I mean, there's
1000 more parameters to go into

a94a4dc5-754b-40f5-80a1-b43ad0318894-1
00:32:08.721 --> 00:32:09.740
product, right?

52d77af8-fbe4-4271-be72-3f8654848e7f-0
00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.919
Yeah, and that was actually I
put these on here because I had

52d77af8-fbe4-4271-be72-3f8654848e7f-1
00:32:14.919 --> 00:32:16.310
a question. Are these?

64cd4c16-429b-4080-af3e-20e6dfed1200-0
00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.750
Because we have so many
parameters. Are they?

6860716c-1522-4dd1-84d0-2eac026e3c63-0
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:26.484
And this is more a Scott, Randy
question. Something that we need

6860716c-1522-4dd1-84d0-2eac026e3c63-1
00:32:26.484 --> 00:32:29.531
to list here or is it more
something that we would

6860716c-1522-4dd1-84d0-2eac026e3c63-2
00:32:29.531 --> 00:32:32.400
parameterize as we're building
out the product?

acabd4fb-74bf-4997-9a73-abf5dfc15bfc-0
00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.595
Do you need to see them on the
model as we're going each of

acabd4fb-74bf-4997-9a73-abf5dfc15bfc-1
00:32:37.595 --> 00:32:40.467
them or do we want to build them
out as we're building out the

acabd4fb-74bf-4997-9a73-abf5dfc15bfc-2
00:32:40.467 --> 00:32:41.470
product down the road?

9f8c28a7-c7a3-49a3-92b8-ffe9ef4e417a-0
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.799
I would like to have Randy over
on my screen over here as where

9f8c28a7-c7a3-49a3-92b8-ffe9ef4e417a-1
00:32:49.799 --> 00:32:50.640
I can see his face.

e3c73070-c8e3-4706-9fa6-4dfdff6ecf9c-0
00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:56.752
I I would, I would. I would say
that we would build them out as

e3c73070-c8e3-4706-9fa6-4dfdff6ecf9c-1
00:32:56.752 --> 00:33:01.529
we go because those in, correct
me if I misunderstand that those

e3c73070-c8e3-4706-9fa6-4dfdff6ecf9c-2
00:33:01.529 --> 00:33:05.864
those are attributes of a
product, my correct. Yeah. Yeah.

e3c73070-c8e3-4706-9fa6-4dfdff6ecf9c-3
00:33:05.864 --> 00:33:10.200
And yeah, since there's quite a
lot of them, I don't know.

9ad30e62-d042-40cf-b6f3-0e1d56b4430a-0
00:33:11.010 --> 00:33:13.807
You know, if we want to do it
here, kind of like what Randy

9ad30e62-d042-40cf-b6f3-0e1d56b4430a-1
00:33:13.807 --> 00:33:15.020
said as we go along, yeah.

015bce31-c3e3-4737-a2eb-bcd8039c2288-0
00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:22.060
Something might get missed
anyway so.

1306f9dc-b79b-42da-82d4-3a5a2750e571-0
00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:27.280
Yeah, if it helps the analogy
it's like.

c38df182-a901-4c5a-bd30-cb3c5748fd57-0
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:28.580
Umm.

bd70c3cd-5fb2-4b03-9040-58c5e12fc696-0
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:30.780
If your entity was a car.

44c637d7-409b-490c-a9ac-5b32f06ed950-0
00:33:31.930 --> 00:33:33.920
Like a property might be that
car is green.

aac36c06-b0fb-433a-852a-2e4e75ec895c-0
00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.640
The strike multiplier and the
quote multiplier like green.

9b4043be-3b57-4632-834a-cf2b0c30e985-0
00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:39.400
OK.

efa80d21-d49b-4044-babd-3de34aa98d4f-0
00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:42.590
So yeah, we don't need them
then.

edca100f-4675-4103-ad47-74bfd3ac4a14-0
00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:51.170
Can you just say attributes?

25ccc959-00c9-4cbe-a480-3b0c704e76a5-0
00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:01.593
Yeah, I'm still, I'm still hung
up on the fact I don't know if

25ccc959-00c9-4cbe-a480-3b0c704e76a5-1
00:34:01.593 --> 00:34:03.220
it corn, soy, wheat, ethanol.

b8988d2e-84f5-4292-b757-97270dcffb37-0
00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:05.460
Physical commodity.

4cbd2cf0-0299-445f-a41b-3cb1f6793ce7-0
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:12.418
But you mean where do you put
like what do you characterize

4cbd2cf0-0299-445f-a41b-3cb1f6793ce7-1
00:34:12.418 --> 00:34:14.080
those underlyings as?

9b3ea5f0-852f-4720-85c5-c104cac9868d-0
00:34:15.550 --> 00:34:17.359
Yeah, and even the underlying
have some hierarchy to it,

9b3ea5f0-852f-4720-85c5-c104cac9868d-1
00:34:17.359 --> 00:34:17.550
right?

8e59608e-796e-442a-a9a8-47313dba8ce2-0
00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:20.570
That's just one week many wheat.

048e2b51-70ba-46c5-9fb0-366177d20300-0
00:34:21.270 --> 00:34:21.530
Yeah.

efcf5829-ddb0-4858-8525-8cdf91ccf18b-0
00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:28.028
Then that probably rolls up into
grains, which rolls up into aggs

efcf5829-ddb0-4858-8525-8cdf91ccf18b-1
00:34:28.028 --> 00:34:29.100
somewhere, right?

fe8fb7ed-6921-40a6-911f-964443c98c89-0
00:34:32.150 --> 00:34:34.980
But there require that hierarchy
for this.

bb884b9f-789a-498d-8503-8495318003b5-0
00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.050
Well, the reason that I'm.

03d52b5b-6b6b-4091-a7d8-9fa9e0dcf69a-0
00:34:39.270 --> 00:34:41.150
Dwelling on it is.

7d83fb74-2226-453d-aa95-5a157a3b3e72-0
00:34:43.530 --> 00:34:45.820
I can't. I can't wrap my brain
around products.

cc0f9ee0-59de-43b9-99bc-8fc7eabe6e95-0
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:52.630
I don't know whether the product
is corn or product is.

356bcfa4-467f-4e0c-8e22-1d35a4c1f44b-0
00:34:53.310 --> 00:35:00.870
Corn futures dated, you know,
December 20232022.

26aeaa96-05a6-4246-a551-5b3cdfa81f3d-0
00:35:01.830 --> 00:35:03.280
And on ice?

5692bb40-1a01-4ba6-b6ab-7254323d3063-0
00:35:04.290 --> 00:35:05.030
And CBOT

fe931043-040f-4814-a16e-d2751521413c-0
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:09.490
Corn would be a physical
commodity product.

720c354a-5adb-43ea-9a3a-f51351c10f7a-0
00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:14.572
A core in future on a particular
exchange with a particular

720c354a-5adb-43ea-9a3a-f51351c10f7a-1
00:35:14.572 --> 00:35:17.590
contract date would be a
financial instrument.

0cf665b3-254c-4627-abee-3e484910966d-0
00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:21.140
That it belongs to a particular
product.

77343640-b02a-4580-a194-0cb7d2d11cb1-0
00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:22.450
So like the.

fe2c7670-8d99-4436-b453-f59ccb7aad8c-0
00:35:23.190 --> 00:35:24.040
The.

a2665a14-9d4d-4a5c-98e8-52b6c74e0c4a-0
00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:29.131
These wheat as there's I guess
more varieties, so KC hard red

a2665a14-9d4d-4a5c-98e8-52b6c74e0c4a-1
00:35:29.131 --> 00:35:29.540
wheat.

ee67cbc3-9228-44eb-87d8-b10d8fdf4302-0
00:35:30.810 --> 00:35:31.510
On.

5dd80b78-2f87-4a53-95d6-e80b3414bbbf-0
00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:35.100
CBOT is a product.

d2bce5ad-42db-4270-92e4-a4a2cf3437c5-0
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:40.840
Casey hard red wheat on CBOT.
The July contract date is an

d2bce5ad-42db-4270-92e4-a4a2cf3437c5-1
00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:41.760
instrument.

f38e01b2-8813-4c2d-8ec3-1b2ac9d9ff5d-0
00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:54.440
So I'm with you there with Casey
hard red wheat.

40dc38b5-99a9-437f-8f32-0424b34fb0da-0
00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.360
On CBOT is it is a product.

20f381bd-cf12-4263-9111-fd4d4fcdd6f3-0
00:35:59.220 --> 00:36:00.630
So, KC, Harvard wheat.

d2400bad-1ab1-42e2-9b96-380cc90196bc-0
00:36:01.630 --> 00:36:02.320
Is a product.

40e1ea03-1668-44b2-b59c-71075111bc17-0
00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:04.790
But.

ed2ffb52-527c-4c50-be50-58f3d932969a-0
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:08.997
The financial instrument seems
tied together. That product KC,

ed2ffb52-527c-4c50-be50-58f3d932969a-1
00:36:08.997 --> 00:36:09.710
hard red wheat

0204bc83-b306-4808-a52e-6c43b1d55d52-0
00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:14.930
Exchange so you bought and an
option.

3f284162-3525-4c7a-a11e-0a4cefa8ca8a-0
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.860
It's a product type

b8396621-67f1-451b-8f79-f555a6a989de-0
00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:22.390
Those three things come together
and then throw in.

744a9b4a-05a0-4d36-a117-718f9a7b3713-0
00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.350
Some date and strike.

50f1bc9d-fb30-4f1a-91db-82a96baf4b80-0
00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.851
Where did we get to options? I
thought we're talking about

50f1bc9d-fb30-4f1a-91db-82a96baf4b80-1
00:36:28.851 --> 00:36:29.140
futures.

279b09ba-7267-4e29-9dc2-5675d986623c-0
00:36:29.810 --> 00:36:31.000
I'm sorry, future.

a276197a-5281-4730-a595-32e1ef1fc4e0-0
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.262
Confirming options because I
have a striking so do we need a

a276197a-5281-4730-a595-32e1ef1fc4e0-1
00:36:36.262 --> 00:36:39.867
product exchange with that? That
is a combination of the product

a276197a-5281-4730-a595-32e1ef1fc4e0-2
00:36:39.867 --> 00:36:43.250
and the exchange that it's on
and that ties to our financial

a276197a-5281-4730-a595-32e1ef1fc4e0-3
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.860
instrument?

53028528-b666-4230-9c7c-c6001699fa2a-0
00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:52.200
I mean, the financial instrument
has an exchange.

a7aec0b4-ba95-41d2-8e21-5f61cb3e6aa3-0
00:36:52.990 --> 00:36:53.900
That much is true.

bf8663bd-cac8-4692-96cb-73fb91245c1a-0
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:58.420
Or at least.

e5d0a949-7f4e-4d57-b140-c7d0c57097fd-0
00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.800
To the same extent that a
product has an exchange.

1abbd5bd-6896-45ba-9933-172b0605da71-0
00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:04.570
Umm.

a6f90fd0-6874-43cd-94ab-03f3299403a3-0
00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:08.580
And also they'll be the same.

e8a6dec2-7a7e-44fb-8c90-f32dabdf5561-0
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:12.600
If the product has an exchange,
any financial instruments

e8a6dec2-7a7e-44fb-8c90-f32dabdf5561-1
00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:15.310
associated with that product
will have the same exchange.

d943a41e-c8c7-4565-9e58-af87bb653ece-0
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:21.650
But if we marry the, if we marry
the product with the exchange in

d943a41e-c8c7-4565-9e58-af87bb653ece-1
00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:24.416
an entity called product
exchange and then that product

d943a41e-c8c7-4565-9e58-af87bb653ece-2
00:37:24.416 --> 00:37:26.590
exchange is tied to a financial
instrument.

039637dc-6202-4838-a32b-a918931536d0-0
00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:27.880
Does that.

89e0a889-751e-40e4-a813-e1902bffc4ae-0
00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:29.850
Solve it for us.

6e11c850-d50e-4908-90f8-94ea02729728-0
00:37:30.570 --> 00:37:33.406
Almost got in this that I think
if we tie a financial instrument

6e11c850-d50e-4908-90f8-94ea02729728-1
00:37:33.406 --> 00:37:33.930
to exchange.

99963262-1878-46f1-b693-cf758d5abc24-0
00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:36.210
Leave product to exchange.

7f2ba7d6-0553-47cb-abef-a7b618b8fc42-0
00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:39.987
Because I think that is a
combination of two like it's an

7f2ba7d6-0553-47cb-abef-a7b618b8fc42-1
00:37:39.987 --> 00:37:40.820
intersection of.

3ea0c992-6050-4137-b548-9e01a6acdf10-0
00:37:41.500 --> 00:37:44.600
KC Red Wheat is defined by.

80c23948-ff22-4c69-aa19-bbc3a09f7564-0
00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:47.690
C1.

19fe825f-9b5e-4027-aceb-436d6e85368d-0
00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:50.480
They define what that means.
They define.

237e601d-a87e-40ed-8c5e-7f3aa8e7b680-0
00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.722
The quality and and and delivery
location is right. That's that's

237e601d-a87e-40ed-8c5e-7f3aa8e7b680-1
00:37:54.722 --> 00:37:55.930
defined by the exchange.

bc92bfba-45a6-4fd2-9095-9f343a92941c-0
00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.550
Yeah. And then the instrument.

8792c36e-c68e-4b9a-bb74-46989d577808-0
00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:02.150
Is also defined by the exchange.
It's saying, OK, here is a.

16272985-1f5d-4029-9725-5c9ec3c86118-0
00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:06.310
Future with this date?

e3ac5547-7e78-424d-a345-632ec57ccf38-0
00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.530
And this quantity and whatnot.

83dcf298-5e88-4e8e-aca8-c7cd27365d5c-0
00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:15.460
And you trade that financial
instrument?

27e793e5-e2c3-45e5-8e02-d5726be75c77-0
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:18.850
Yep.

cc8e6e9b-211d-46b6-ab7f-032e89fbe17d-0
00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.924
Exactly, see this. This looks
good to me and the only I just

cc8e6e9b-211d-46b6-ab7f-032e89fbe17d-1
00:38:22.924 --> 00:38:25.300
still think I would break out
product type.

82e8a957-c7de-4644-b770-a7ab2aa9936c-0
00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:28.770
And leave product to be really
the underlying.

88ff91ce-7633-4783-b951-53b5f72baf55-0
00:38:32.110 --> 00:38:32.830
So you'd have.

cbf18d64-aed5-4baa-97a4-94d2d45f2528-0
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:37.704
Future option, future product
option product and physical

cbf18d64-aed5-4baa-97a4-94d2d45f2528-1
00:38:37.704 --> 00:38:40.160
commodity product as their own
entities.

e49a47a4-2f71-4bdc-aac7-4b8d766adeb7-0
00:38:43.520 --> 00:38:46.790
Now something just add one more
fry type entity.

e165c6dd-1f4c-440e-9e34-052744c6b34d-0
00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:50.152
Actually, can you bring it
towards the center, because I

e165c6dd-1f4c-440e-9e34-052744c6b34d-1
00:38:50.152 --> 00:38:52.670
want to make the financial
statement the combination of all

e165c6dd-1f4c-440e-9e34-052744c6b34d-2
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:53.300
three of those.

315e5e7e-93fa-418e-9ff2-97077cc585be-0
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:03.160
Yeah, and this would be future
options and physical quantity.

5f91056b-d5d1-4dc0-8358-453c9b1ff19d-0
00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:04.320
Right.

8a0bef43-e075-4153-bbdb-e33bcabd09f0-0
00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:08.830
And the product has a product
type.

87e2cb1a-57ec-4d12-bcd7-b9115610d48f-0
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:18.290
No, the product goes to
financial instrument.

aeccb951-ab16-41b0-9904-8a9e57d8086c-0
00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:24.110
Let me just jump in there and do
that.

4758b175-d62e-4cb1-b93a-5b963975b280-0
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:25.960
I'm thinking.

ef9a82c6-637a-476d-9788-de2c3c3c70e1-0
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:35.000
Go ahead. So I would remove this
here.

aa32ba12-1a49-459a-b7f6-49bfcc08f966-0
00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.883
Because you you trade a
financial. You don't trade corn,

aa32ba12-1a49-459a-b7f6-49bfcc08f966-1
00:39:38.883 --> 00:39:40.020
you trade instrument.

4046dd44-1261-48a2-a8f6-eafade8f9c97-0
00:39:42.340 --> 00:39:45.570
And then they need to have a
product type though well.

3806d0bb-98c4-4e93-a01a-ed5251466d2f-0
00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.520
I'm saying that.

c5ba8b3f-28cb-45ca-9898-9fb06e4487b5-0
00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.150
No, KC Red wheat is KC red
wheat.

4987623b-8e30-411a-9a11-052349bf7eaf-0
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:54.800
And only turns into something.

ac24278c-b466-42b8-be8a-b5a5f6c56ae1-0
00:39:57.050 --> 00:39:57.650
Can you do that?

08facb4d-348c-4a99-ba65-961245ffaa69-0
00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:01.450
Hold on here.

c7cfb1e5-7bbe-4dca-b4b7-072472a83688-0
00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:12.870


ba783a2c-1381-4e8c-be97-cd262c004e6f-0
00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:18.360
Let me turn this one around.

963f3211-69c6-46c9-a392-896a2d2d8e1e-0
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.180
I'm not sure this is the right
description, but.

12e2ecab-9517-4410-964c-c7b18a92fcbc-0
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:40.670
So the financial instrument?

903eea7d-61f9-4763-adac-4c8295292bd5-0
00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.160
You got to help me clean that
one up, but.

ca29c5ce-175b-47cf-b582-303e9f1945a1-0
00:40:59.710 --> 00:41:02.109
Yeah, I can do that. I can move
the lines and everything around.

ca29c5ce-175b-47cf-b582-303e9f1945a1-1
00:41:02.109 --> 00:41:03.770
I just want to be sure that they
make sense.

31b8ce2d-7dfc-4cb2-b3db-4b940b52dd05-0
00:41:10.690 --> 00:41:14.550
So product is defined by an
exchange of financial

31b8ce2d-7dfc-4cb2-b3db-4b940b52dd05-1
00:41:14.550 --> 00:41:15.400
instrument.

db1d3faa-cfac-4818-a534-df10fcaab587-0
00:41:17.230 --> 00:41:17.820
Was.

f3cd4213-7ffc-4392-8a6b-ecfefe64ef39-0
00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:22.580
Find by and traded.

7ed2c552-5652-47a4-9a8f-857486d1dfa0-0
00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:24.710
Exchange.

b6733619-e19f-4085-8c58-0073a6f2bd27-0
00:41:34.690 --> 00:41:35.550
So.

6865c382-9409-4a58-8a45-9a1474b701c1-0
00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:43.290
Moves out to here just for a
second and so.

dbdeff17-dcdf-4438-9e9e-05c9684f4703-0
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:45.860
Yeah, that's not the copy.

9a2c1faa-e869-48eb-8fa2-65d1a257f49e-0
00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.490
Nice, filled with mockups as I
am with the other stuff.

25d9fff4-30d5-46a3-acd2-e90d74f118b9-0
00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.510
We can't see what you're doing
until you click out of it.

ba0b2e60-1264-448d-9fad-1caadf8e18ee-0
00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.429
You need to move your option
group over to product type as

ba0b2e60-1264-448d-9fad-1caadf8e18ee-1
00:42:21.429 --> 00:42:21.980
well, right?

1a3a0a0d-a7e6-42c3-9d72-e34a97321b2d-0
00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:27.020
Because if the product type is
an option, that option has an

1a3a0a0d-a7e6-42c3-9d72-e34a97321b2d-1
00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:27.560
option group.

04ba8288-1602-4ffd-9871-9bca632cc572-0
00:42:32.950 --> 00:42:36.130
I would put that over on a
financial instrument.

3f5b942e-af41-4452-9ca7-288594526621-0
00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.970
Because you would group like an
options chain together.

19e4cff5-520a-4a8c-91f4-adfdf083dea6-0
00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:53.080
Right, you would Group 3 futures
together. You group.

8335910a-5ece-4c16-945a-6c4144d5e8d9-0
00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:54.700
Options together.

cc48e6d9-8e4f-4ed0-bd30-14ddd60bfb35-0
00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:59.090
Right. So you're you're gonna
group KC red wheat?

4c445a14-bde3-4834-b7d8-d92710be2ebb-0
00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.150
Options chain.

a190b44a-867a-4e9d-a9cd-dae1e2d81cbc-0
00:43:03.600 --> 00:43:07.470
Into an option group? No, I
don't think so, no.

255a3d73-8742-40a0-a89f-f270e3f8d9f6-0
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:12.810
But that's there's another
hierarchy in there.

2e740b0f-97eb-48d7-a708-1febc4054d79-0
00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:14.100
So.

d868681e-2842-4ab7-8e4b-db500152cfd0-0
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:17.870
KC hard red wheat.

c5e577d4-c1ed-45b7-80b8-4ec39c978479-0
00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.330
Options.

79de001b-e842-418b-bd7a-37f14ad3a12c-0
00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:26.532
Roll up into a product and then
KC hard red wheat options and

79de001b-e842-418b-bd7a-37f14ad3a12c-1
00:43:26.532 --> 00:43:30.690
KChard Red wheat weekly options.
Roll up into an option group.

59517785-4e7c-4997-b211-d221321cdbaf-0
00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:34.760
Hmm.

baa4548d-204e-4bd8-960e-7ba6f81dd42a-0
00:43:36.010 --> 00:43:37.330
This is a time dimension.

1165ebd6-330a-4d99-9329-b2b5e0d9a16a-0
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:44.462
Well, it's just arbitrary. Like
basically because the exchange

1165ebd6-330a-4d99-9329-b2b5e0d9a16a-1
00:43:44.462 --> 00:43:47.120
system suck. They can't do a.

28a9e59f-bea9-45ac-9e83-c9ec20be5ead-0
00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:52.208
Like, they can't handle a weekly
option and a monthly option at

28a9e59f-bea9-45ac-9e83-c9ec20be5ead-1
00:43:52.208 --> 00:43:56.104
the same time, so they pretend
that weekly options are monthly

28a9e59f-bea9-45ac-9e83-c9ec20be5ead-2
00:43:56.104 --> 00:43:57.960
options and have five of them.

30cefebb-8bb6-4ef4-96b1-525dbb93363f-0
00:43:58.650 --> 00:44:01.110
So that there's a there's a
first week.

ad8fe4be-2c05-45ed-9a6a-6b52dbe9101c-0
00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.886
Hard wheat option, a second
week. Hard Red wheat option A

ad8fe4be-2c05-45ed-9a6a-6b52dbe9101c-1
00:44:04.886 --> 00:44:08.078
third week hard week option in
the 4th week and a fifth week.

ad8fe4be-2c05-45ed-9a6a-6b52dbe9101c-2
00:44:08.078 --> 00:44:11.373
And those are five products that
are all different flavors of a

ad8fe4be-2c05-45ed-9a6a-6b52dbe9101c-3
00:44:11.373 --> 00:44:14.360
weekly hard weed option. So
those five products plus the.

5f48433a-01a3-4cac-9289-7116b8777ec9-0
00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:17.754
The regular roll up into the
option group, and then there's

5f48433a-01a3-4cac-9289-7116b8777ec9-1
00:44:17.754 --> 00:44:20.490
also short data which rolls up
into the option group with them.

f0d34e49-99e6-4bb4-a71b-c1c70b8e5a0d-0
00:44:28.330 --> 00:44:32.156
And it's also influenced by the
exchange choices. It's not like

f0d34e49-99e6-4bb4-a71b-c1c70b8e5a0d-1
00:44:32.156 --> 00:44:35.922
a fundamental thing, like if a
new exchange started up and had

f0d34e49-99e6-4bb4-a71b-c1c70b8e5a0d-2
00:44:35.922 --> 00:44:39.808
a less crappy system, they would
probably put all of those eight

f0d34e49-99e6-4bb4-a71b-c1c70b8e5a0d-3
00:44:39.808 --> 00:44:42.080
products. Or what was it, 6
products?

9d82157d-adb8-4971-99c0-233d426f8494-0
00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:45.630
No 7 products into the same
product.

f58a5da3-011e-4d20-9752-c3e8b40f4784-0
00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:49.742
And in that case we would model
in our system as also a single

f58a5da3-011e-4d20-9752-c3e8b40f4784-1
00:44:49.742 --> 00:44:50.120
product.

7f84afc4-8f0a-48fe-b432-123dc2ae6b54-0
00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:54.080
And the contract date would
basically be the.

25bda201-d2fd-41af-bfff-43d796d1e956-0
00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:55.960
The.

2dd81225-cf2e-4c96-815b-8b174c39a130-0
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:59.590
Would sort of hold the variation
there.

6d031b4d-5220-4727-942e-650f737c3866-0
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:02.410
And the underline.

6db4718f-9dd8-4174-a9d6-b768814835f6-0
00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:18.760
Sure.

ed81e01e-b796-4b87-a0dc-1d3688508bab-0
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:27.620
I can.

5d673e50-6714-479f-9ff0-4914a3316bdc-0
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:30.220
I'm getting the disconnect.

32e04423-d2c4-4be7-af91-63f683ed6ebf-0
00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:35.247
All right answer for it, but I
do know that when you go look to

32e04423-d2c4-4be7-af91-63f683ed6ebf-1
00:45:35.247 --> 00:45:35.460
the.

31aa2904-00eb-4466-aac9-7f113a2574c1-0
00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:38.120
You know the product slate.

d9383344-0b85-422c-9fc9-0490011f3a92-0
00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.790
I was just looking at CME, but.

1eb7a830-fbe6-4332-8d35-b5e2786b2d26-0
00:45:50.070 --> 00:45:53.323
Yeah, this is, this is kind of
where I'm going with this being

1eb7a830-fbe6-4332-8d35-b5e2786b2d26-1
00:45:53.323 --> 00:45:53.840
a product.

6b608e6b-119f-4334-b0fb-c50e2cb1c7f7-0
00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.180
Umm.

5dbd8a7e-4fdc-46b7-a0b4-cb74732650c7-0
00:46:02.410 --> 00:46:05.150
Which gives all the details of
that product.

72a33e7b-89d5-452a-ab65-a297d5fb9d50-0
00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:07.210
Umm.

f8cd1979-2288-4706-93ae-5c85661aa8a1-0
00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:16.066
And then really you're you're
trading contracts, right, the

f8cd1979-2288-4706-93ae-5c85661aa8a1-1
00:46:16.066 --> 00:46:16.850
the contracts?

da82f718-8122-4981-bff7-5563ee0d04d4-0
00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:19.750
Define.

ed60c637-68c1-44e2-9657-730ab40fb687-0
00:46:21.830 --> 00:46:22.890
The financial instrument.

75be8ac9-2b14-4abd-a603-b2671abaac6d-0
00:46:25.610 --> 00:46:28.640
Up my product is essentially a
contract template.

bcbfa1af-7299-49d1-9f27-f4bceb14da11-0
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:30.720
And then.

55881a1d-daed-4380-b0af-b6d99ca67b26-0
00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:35.106
A specific instance of filling
in those missing parameters in

55881a1d-daed-4380-b0af-b6d99ca67b26-1
00:46:35.106 --> 00:46:37.360
the contract are a financial
instrument.

425137fd-191d-4eb3-b50f-bba6bceb10f3-0
00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:42.810
So in the case of options, say,
the parameters are.

a97690bb-9e7a-4217-a930-c39c026568ca-0
00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:45.660
Expiration date.

e5b4e8c5-894c-4327-8d2d-4ef6a25577e6-0
00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:49.700
Underlying instruments.

e6ddcbc4-20c9-4b3f-81ee-113114d61a0f-0
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:54.010
And strike and write.

a4e717ac-5b69-4e1c-a4c6-a78f11c812e5-0
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:12.000
I'm going to violate something
here.

60b8e841-42f3-4c12-91af-c83186a7c968-0
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:14.280
Oops.

6bcb4920-8fd6-4c52-b880-d153dda095a8-0
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:30.110
Is the financial instrument. The
contractor is the product.

f10b591d-15d9-4dd2-97ea-aced71dda45c-0
00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:34.010
Scott, which did you just say?

ee66fcd3-b2c6-443e-a0fd-ed2bf67271f5-0
00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:38.700
Like, you have to sort of make
up words here and define what

ee66fcd3-b2c6-443e-a0fd-ed2bf67271f5-1
00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.332
they mean, because the actual
English words are ambiguous,

ee66fcd3-b2c6-443e-a0fd-ed2bf67271f5-2
00:47:41.332 --> 00:47:43.250
like when you're talking about a
contract.

8d8a61f6-8c73-4bff-bf0a-d0e20349d3e7-0
00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:48.090
As associated with, say, a
futures contract or an options

8d8a61f6-8c73-4bff-bf0a-d0e20349d3e7-1
00:47:48.090 --> 00:47:48.600
contract.

00b2ecb2-ac76-4b89-88bb-fd3fddef63f1-0
00:47:49.270 --> 00:47:52.080
You could be talking about the.

d18411ba-4d53-4f1f-a150-082b1211c2d2-0
00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:58.480
Like the number of units that
you trade, like if you buy 5

d18411ba-4d53-4f1f-a150-082b1211c2d2-1
00:47:58.480 --> 00:47:59.560
contracts of.

cfc85d4a-75e3-42cd-82a7-7cdf583f2f3e-0
00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:04.080
Buy futures contracts. That's
like the quantity in your trade.

114d0887-2aa0-4291-8299-96b8ff2f7825-0
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:06.690
You could also be talking about
the contract.

7900b4ea-a2bc-4da0-8b9a-11d49da442f6-0
00:48:07.230 --> 00:48:08.270


1b7ec9b5-a941-401b-a183-e1fbc89f0c6a-0
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.830
As.

ea7b8784-86d6-421b-a0d7-f5c45a8b29f8-0
00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:13.730
Like essentially a synonym for
product.

adfebda3-6ed2-4f00-adae-3276927cf2f0-0
00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:19.221
And you could also talk about
contract as the template

adfebda3-6ed2-4f00-adae-3276927cf2f0-1
00:48:19.221 --> 00:48:20.160
essentially.

03384af0-d6fe-4347-b2ac-c2585c328deb-0
00:48:21.090 --> 00:48:24.478
That shows up in the exchange
rules. That is the product. You

03384af0-d6fe-4347-b2ac-c2585c328deb-1
00:48:24.478 --> 00:48:26.500
could also use it to talk about
the.

e0f8e579-dd6a-45f6-b9ec-9a8515f205dd-0
00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:31.452
Specific future that you're
trading. Like you could use

e0f8e579-dd6a-45f6-b9ec-9a8515f205dd-1
00:48:31.452 --> 00:48:34.570
contract to mean any of those
four things, basically.

bb8cf2ab-2366-4e49-ba34-397e46bb2b6e-0
00:48:35.460 --> 00:48:36.950


007ac49c-a1cf-4794-a3b2-28220bad94e5-0
00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:40.754
Like it just in common usage.
You talked to some random person

007ac49c-a1cf-4794-a3b2-28220bad94e5-1
00:48:40.754 --> 00:48:43.250
in the industry. They could be
in any of those things, OK.

2009d8f5-07de-4365-a0d5-8dd1d82af786-0
00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:46.301
Do you want me to, like, show
you examples of sort of what I'm

2009d8f5-07de-4365-a0d5-8dd1d82af786-1
00:48:46.301 --> 00:48:46.990
talking about here?

5f1ef220-62af-42ee-8313-2d807f9a7862-0
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:51.220
Yeah, different levels. Can I
share my screen too?

84549e9d-ae63-42b4-8de6-614b074e64c8-0
00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:55.110
Or I don't know, maybe maybe I
could drive if I could do a web

84549e9d-ae63-42b4-8de6-614b074e64c8-1
00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:57.453
web browser? Maybe that would be
a better way to do it rather

84549e9d-ae63-42b4-8de6-614b074e64c8-2
00:48:57.453 --> 00:48:59.040
than so we have to switch back
and forth.

c79d4c9c-1952-4620-9310-98987b5d319f-0
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.010
No, you did it right, OK.

a152ed25-c185-4739-99aa-02ba22b99b6f-0
00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:04.180
Uh.

c64f4a3d-b7f7-4bd9-bc2a-4bc023b45064-0
00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:25.750
No.

bb78aae4-801d-44aa-a1eb-984f600ca2e4-0
00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:41.520
So this is a list of all of the
CME, CME groups products.

7875e2f0-0524-44c6-8233-830764864963-0
00:49:44.550 --> 00:49:45.080
So.

be9e10f8-a634-4e4f-b228-410d7a1d2243-0
00:49:45.730 --> 00:49:46.710
Rare.

a70068c3-c212-41e1-b339-69e1560f166a-0
00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.830
grains

9ded57a3-4e6a-457d-9039-e92d74d9e110-0
00:49:56.180 --> 00:49:57.490
I'll see you about.

121303d3-ffc3-4812-bfa1-ddfe21f72534-0
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:00.230
So just pause for one second.

ee46f8c9-36af-417d-b108-14aa1ce70d8e-0
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:05.460
So that shows corn options, corn
futures as being products.

f5a43c7c-4da6-484e-a5fe-bba899aa5821-0
00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:06.660
Yep.

c63fec8c-c2f4-409d-ab9a-bf0d3e481291-0
00:50:10.370 --> 00:50:12.300
So then you drill down into corn
futures.

29dae611-52f9-44b9-83a5-9b23aab3d184-0
00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:17.480
And you've got.

0fa1bb9e-6fe1-4a4e-9f9a-7e1aa51088ac-0
00:50:20.560 --> 00:50:22.060
All of these different
instruments.

3a807701-ce32-4458-8c26-bfd2096fe704-0
00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:25.500
That are parameterized by their.

67e2d893-ad49-4c92-8f94-86a2548db346-0
00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.040
Contract date.

3c239026-664d-431b-8380-ddc29a423e12-0
00:50:28.430 --> 00:50:31.008
These contract date, March,
contract date, may contract

3c239026-664d-431b-8380-ddc29a423e12-1
00:50:31.008 --> 00:50:32.160
date, etcetera, etcetera.

7de9ee11-1ade-4bb1-8c60-d85201c4e5bc-0
00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:34.160
Umm.

0669e0ab-d3b3-4459-b4c5-b67161268f97-0
00:50:35.870 --> 00:50:38.745
They're also specs that apply to
the corner options, and these

0669e0ab-d3b3-4459-b4c5-b67161268f97-1
00:50:38.745 --> 00:50:41.483
are common, essentially, or
parameterized across all of the

0669e0ab-d3b3-4459-b4c5-b67161268f97-2
00:50:41.483 --> 00:50:41.940
different.

856b4bb6-7aec-4bec-adaa-6f55b079c428-0
00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:43.510
Instruments.

57583b21-273e-4a66-8f7e-0462d10c6b7a-0
00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:48.120
So they share the same product
code.

c09d9e1e-fe80-4540-a499-bdacc0a04d31-0
00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:52.440
They will be one of the.

1cd9d5f0-3039-4abe-a08e-ceda29091779-0
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:54.600
Acceptable months.

0d2845bf-66f4-4ea1-a09e-577aa064ef79-0
00:50:56.270 --> 00:50:57.950
They have the same settlement
method.

f2d385d7-4cd7-4ffb-853e-79b074f44540-0
00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.750
They have sort of the same
formula for when trading stops.

72358edc-3190-4ee0-8cd9-ad771b0af69d-0
00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:08.930
Um, etcetera, etcetera. Then you
can look at the actual rules.

0022806b-aa7b-4885-8414-1fa14aaa4549-0
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:15.020
So this includes things like.

f02e0da9-4c9e-4e88-998c-ebf93259869a-0
00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:20.890
You deliver 5000 bushels of #2
yellow corn at par.

c6d91803-ba10-4fba-93db-4cef61d51a21-0
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:25.802
#1 yellow corn at 1 1/2 cents
per bushel over #3 yellow corn

c6d91803-ba10-4fba-93db-4cef61d51a21-1
00:51:25.802 --> 00:51:28.050
between two and four cents
under.

bcb61335-8ceb-4340-b42b-1d94e3e3293b-0
00:51:30.060 --> 00:51:31.090
Umm.

d5a5e459-56a4-44b0-a88b-6e3ae835cf9e-0
00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:33.220
Etcetera, etcetera.

29b05259-feaa-4ec8-b2f0-641c096eff32-0
00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:36.020
Then we've got stuff like.

a36311ad-027d-475d-8163-2b30aace02ef-0
00:51:38.830 --> 00:51:42.541
We mostly saw these already.
There's the differentials I made

a36311ad-027d-475d-8163-2b30aace02ef-1
00:51:42.541 --> 00:51:43.380
the locations.

dbf5d3b2-fa7f-4822-9d72-83b834bd685e-0
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.350
Umm.

4ef8f5c3-2f01-4bd3-a343-69c571f4711e-0
00:51:48.340 --> 00:51:49.610
You can deliver it in Chicago.

de3c1472-c621-4c82-9a8f-37f85e57c7c4-0
00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.120
Can deliver it and Lockport
Seneca.

264189f6-efea-4ae1-90e5-a888a149ddc4-0
00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.160
For a change in the price.

7311297e-e2dd-4fa7-8124-440baf59d6be-0
00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:02.320
Ottawa, Chillicothe, Peoria,
Pecan, Havana, Grafton, St.

7311297e-e2dd-4fa7-8124-440baf59d6be-1
00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:03.710
Louis de Saint Louis.

ab4d6e63-6ef9-4309-93e1-093892b26590-0
00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:09.540
We have all this stuff.

bf72b8db-d408-494f-8a71-f706fe9d084f-0
00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:15.240
The payment system you have to
use.

d441a571-314b-48d9-bb1c-db0c0674654f-0
00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:17.700


f7a8244a-5636-4987-a776-8bb6054e30a3-0
00:52:28.150 --> 00:52:30.662
There's all this stuff about
shipping certificates, which I

f7a8244a-5636-4987-a776-8bb6054e30a3-1
00:52:30.662 --> 00:52:31.960
think has to do with insurance.

f6ec0bf9-4506-4505-9d74-89d3bba62b14-0
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:34.190
Uh.

d7e084b2-1513-4e38-8b9e-81d1b8bddac2-0
00:52:37.300 --> 00:52:41.430
Anyway, essentially this is like
the contract template. Like all

d7e084b2-1513-4e38-8b9e-81d1b8bddac2-1
00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:44.989
of this stuff is about the
definition of what is a corn

d7e084b2-1513-4e38-8b9e-81d1b8bddac2-2
00:52:44.989 --> 00:52:46.070
futures contract.

8bf1bf3a-8f44-481c-b5a3-035e25a49840-0
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:48.620


2228f5b3-7c90-4f88-8fbf-52d020f794c5-0
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:56.740
So then like I guess as I was
talking here, one usage of

2228f5b3-7c90-4f88-8fbf-52d020f794c5-1
00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:57.440
contract is.

8e3664a5-019d-4e0f-a919-59c5ffb9c6f4-0
00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:01.870
Essentially like this level,
each of these is a contract.

5945c339-a4b4-43c6-a491-a82836072955-0
00:53:02.850 --> 00:53:04.230
You could say that in common
usage.

a9882dca-c671-4bd4-bca1-7ecc816c08c5-0
00:53:04.950 --> 00:53:05.840
You could say.

bef42772-04d9-4b47-ac80-210d3f06c59d-0
00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:07.170
That.

4fc197aa-2fa5-49b5-a7a3-4ed66dc12be6-0
00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:11.570
Like each of these is a
contract.

d9bc3ec1-091b-457a-a37a-89aa4ca73a8d-0
00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:16.650
You could say that this is the
contract.

8e907f74-655f-4514-8d48-cac6055758b7-0
00:53:18.770 --> 00:53:21.572
And then you can say if you
bought like ten of these, 10 is

8e907f74-655f-4514-8d48-cac6055758b7-1
00:53:21.572 --> 00:53:24.608
the number of contracts that you
bought. Like all of those would

8e907f74-655f-4514-8d48-cac6055758b7-2
00:53:24.608 --> 00:53:27.644
be pretty common to hear someone
talk about and you have to just

8e907f74-655f-4514-8d48-cac6055758b7-3
00:53:27.644 --> 00:53:29.700
know what they are by contacts
essentially.

80716f12-4097-42d8-8595-d73e0fd4c705-0
00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:32.670


91fe5bfa-daf8-4241-a747-e743a70fec3c-0
00:53:34.050 --> 00:53:36.564
But the way I would talk about
them is sort of to remove the

91fe5bfa-daf8-4241-a747-e743a70fec3c-1
00:53:36.564 --> 00:53:38.420
contract language because it's
so ambiguous.

067110c0-eb71-4b75-8e43-1ff472aadcf5-0
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:42.070
Right. And say this is a
product.

3e0c0191-8bd1-42d9-8a8a-47c46d215675-0
00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:45.190
This is an instrument.

1c86dde4-11fa-4839-a05d-8b9bf53ad99c-0
00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:48.960
It's specifically a futures
instrument.

5d838621-f20f-4a8d-97d0-8bd0e7f2ceb8-0
00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.528
That is therefore defined by the
combination of the product and

5d838621-f20f-4a8d-97d0-8bd0e7f2ceb8-1
00:53:53.528 --> 00:53:56.340
the contract date, which in this
case is D's 2022.

93268d52-cd0c-4a0e-8637-3107395c4415-0
00:53:56.910 --> 00:53:58.980


e4b087dd-3d61-45b0-a9fe-e4320792dd71-0
00:53:59.650 --> 00:54:02.370
And I would usually talk about
this as the rules.

268eb486-bb52-42b3-812f-5ab2ca672da3-0
00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:04.440
For the specs.

1e56b716-9a60-42da-9bd5-39deab116c8c-0
00:54:11.090 --> 00:54:13.090
And we do have the exchange in
here as well.

93e7a9db-707b-4aef-8958-ca43ecc37dff-0
00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:17.000
Yeah, yeah. It's like.

4f2c87fc-4923-4735-8c90-c43926df8ebb-0
00:54:18.870 --> 00:54:22.520
Hello, I guess they do have like
probably ice has a corn truck

4f2c87fc-4923-4735-8c90-c43926df8ebb-1
00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:24.780
corn contract that no one cares
about.

38d375bc-1421-461e-aa24-24caa8739f11-0
00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:31.251
But yeah, it's sort of implicit,
like, right, based on the

38d375bc-1421-461e-aa24-24caa8739f11-1
00:54:31.251 --> 00:54:33.380
product. Yeah. And also like.

66c1889a-1bd9-406d-8776-5a9438b5e78a-0
00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:37.383
They're generally not going to
be fungible, right? Like corn

66c1889a-1bd9-406d-8776-5a9438b5e78a-1
00:54:37.383 --> 00:54:37.530
on.

20e72a9c-71c3-4e87-8029-932ffb6ca6d8-0
00:54:38.550 --> 00:54:41.600
Ice is not going to be fungible
with corn on CME Group.

89f6bb0a-f79b-4e08-b584-8ef71a63c0ae-0
00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:48.458
Definitely not the futures,
right? And possibly like they

89f6bb0a-f79b-4e08-b584-8ef71a63c0ae-1
00:54:48.458 --> 00:54:51.087
might even have different
delivery grade requirements and

89f6bb0a-f79b-4e08-b584-8ef71a63c0ae-2
00:54:51.087 --> 00:54:51.450
whatnot.

81e00425-77f0-4c02-873b-2db85487c1ce-0
00:54:52.910 --> 00:54:53.390
Umm.

28914c61-07ca-4155-a77c-00fb01bb5a37-0
00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:56.980
Uh.

3699e092-1672-4ad3-9b70-2efb5eb39bae-0
00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.340


8689d7d1-abab-4365-80d1-04f3aac45274-0
00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:01.630
ok

665f117e-f13e-47ac-bcdb-79cbf2faac99-0
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:08.037
What else I don't know? Does
that give a better picture of

665f117e-f13e-47ac-bcdb-79cbf2faac99-1
00:55:08.037 --> 00:55:10.600
what I'm talking about by that
of the different entities?

5bf5a7e3-9235-4ef5-850b-a29cd7e33734-0
00:55:12.340 --> 00:55:14.830
Yes, so.

9dd976e0-4645-46b3-b545-b9df8a5ac350-0
00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.720
I get over my hump there a
little bit.

49d58d8a-c4f9-4b72-8ba5-c2826996dec4-0
00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:28.632
These two want to go back to
Kevin. It'll be easier since

49d58d8a-c4f9-4b72-8ba5-c2826996dec4-1
00:55:28.632 --> 00:55:31.783
you're making the changes. It's
going to be easier if you share.

49d58d8a-c4f9-4b72-8ba5-c2826996dec4-2
00:55:31.783 --> 00:55:33.820
That way. We can see it as
you're typing.

0d083868-d233-444b-b2e8-ddf654e82d30-0
00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:37.875
Because otherwise we can't see
anything until you click off of

0d083868-d233-444b-b2e8-ddf654e82d30-1
00:55:37.875 --> 00:55:40.580
it. Is that the way it works?
I'm like you don't have to stop.

362be146-17bb-4ac3-805e-ee8a4efa9449-0
00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.695
You took it. You know, I'm
saying that, like when you were

362be146-17bb-4ac3-805e-ee8a4efa9449-1
00:55:44.695 --> 00:55:47.911
typing it was. I was seeing it
in real time. Yeah, because

362be146-17bb-4ac3-805e-ee8a4efa9449-2
00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:51.236
you're typing, we can't see it
until you click off of it. It

362be146-17bb-4ac3-805e-ee8a4efa9449-3
00:55:51.236 --> 00:55:54.670
makes sense to me now because
you can only see my changes. You

362be146-17bb-4ac3-805e-ee8a4efa9449-4
00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:57.886
can't see what I'm typing. OK,
so that's good. We've got a

362be146-17bb-4ac3-805e-ee8a4efa9449-5
00:55:57.886 --> 00:56:00.230
little complicated as we're
talking about.

b4ccd048-aea5-49e5-91b9-eb54f29a1c66-0
00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:04.550
Let's do a product for a second.
So products.

b99e5f33-eb47-43b6-ae7f-327bb9e9e317-0
00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:07.150
Um.

b0f8745a-069d-4cd2-aacc-5e58ee77a2d0-0
00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:12.494
Scott, what you said made a ton
of sense when you brought the

b0f8745a-069d-4cd2-aacc-5e58ee77a2d0-1
00:56:12.494 --> 00:56:13.580
example there of of.

b3c55e57-42e0-4b3a-90fc-2ae3b9849320-0
00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:18.950
Your corn futures, corn options.

8fcd5b8c-549c-46a3-bc4e-259a7aa2cd39-0
00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:24.000
Darn it.

ef579f79-127f-4f7f-8940-2ef0b63955b1-0
00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:26.140
Oh, there's a problem.

ce862fb3-019e-450e-895e-4c635f8db23f-0
00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:28.470
Umm.

00a22c88-1b98-46ce-a4d5-15c34b90119a-0
00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:31.510
This way.

e50f321f-621b-4367-be76-a27de09c54ab-0
00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.550


0dd0a28b-4d7b-4ce8-a35e-fe30177594e2-0
00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:54.240
Is that me or is it the exchange
here?

dfad0663-d71c-4437-871b-bda0376b3d69-0
00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:13.400
Bizarre.

0eede782-48bf-4c95-8ac3-468cb0944f46-0
00:57:15.950 --> 00:57:16.470
Ohh.

0a497001-1aed-4391-8ad0-185f3fe3cb37-0
00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:21.030
That's probably it. Refresh
immediately, it works again.

bcc0866a-fa8d-495c-bfdc-8578133961d2-0
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:29.020
OK. So what you were saying
about?

12c5cd1e-c0bc-4c5d-b609-5793ed0e03d7-0
00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:33.974
Options and futures as being
separate products now make sense

12c5cd1e-c0bc-4c5d-b609-5793ed0e03d7-1
00:57:33.974 --> 00:57:38.134
to me. So the way I model that
is a product being like KC hard

12c5cd1e-c0bc-4c5d-b609-5793ed0e03d7-2
00:57:38.134 --> 00:57:41.040
wheat, we futures, KC Harbor
wheat options.

2c2a60af-0cbc-4edb-8ec8-e4e32d6d9abc-0
00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:45.440
By the way, I like the KC part
because it means Kevin Carney,

2c2a60af-0cbc-4edb-8ec8-e4e32d6d9abc-1
00:57:45.440 --> 00:57:47.000
right? Is that stands for.

2d95ce6c-01fe-4abd-92c8-cf634b3e2fea-0
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:49.850
Absolutely.

9a20d699-dc50-4334-8b16-0d9c5e542f7b-0
00:57:51.170 --> 00:57:55.206
Check your ego at the door. But
then I I put in a prototype,

9a20d699-dc50-4334-8b16-0d9c5e542f7b-1
00:57:55.206 --> 00:57:57.060
which is probably more of a.

c01443ed-9def-4602-875e-8d6c80a3c7dc-0
00:57:57.880 --> 00:58:03.670
You know second class entity of
being it's a future and option.

56a5645a-4bb3-4779-9169-86f4baab1f18-0
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:09.480
But that's not a core and I I
put hanging off the product.

a075e38c-1983-44fb-b0d7-b2a3cedf37bd-0
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:13.407
Because now if a product is
defined that it is a corn

a075e38c-1983-44fb-b0d7-b2a3cedf37bd-1
00:58:13.407 --> 00:58:13.810
option.

aa7fa478-9ca0-4fcf-ad58-f68a626ccb07-0
00:58:16.810 --> 00:58:20.140
Then you would have options.

c622d03d-7345-401d-b346-bb65b6d331fc-0
00:58:21.390 --> 00:58:25.854
And maybe with I turn this
around here they have a certain

c622d03d-7345-401d-b346-bb65b6d331fc-1
00:58:25.854 --> 00:58:29.260
strike price, a certain
expiration date, so.

04286b9f-7835-4700-97aa-b0f71958c1cd-0
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:40.070
I'll pause that for a second. We
come back so products like KC,

04286b9f-7835-4700-97aa-b0f71958c1cd-1
00:58:40.070 --> 00:58:43.324
hard wheat futures would have
product attributes, which I

04286b9f-7835-4700-97aa-b0f71958c1cd-2
00:58:43.324 --> 00:58:46.971
think you had here earlier model
Denise as separate items. But I

04286b9f-7835-4700-97aa-b0f71958c1cd-3
00:58:46.971 --> 00:58:49.440
kind of threw it all into like a
bucket of.

66e16e89-b03d-4e9c-9d48-487da6c0560d-0
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:53.931
With the units are and the
quality, you know, as you said

66e16e89-b03d-4e9c-9d48-487da6c0560d-1
00:58:53.931 --> 00:58:57.782
like #1 corn, something like
that. Price increments. You can

66e16e89-b03d-4e9c-9d48-487da6c0560d-2
00:58:57.782 --> 00:59:01.570
increment and and and and and
sense or hundreds of cents or

66e16e89-b03d-4e9c-9d48-487da6c0560d-3
00:59:01.570 --> 00:59:03.780
whatever trading hours
settlement.

9179f0d8-5fb1-413e-8c35-f79eabbfebe0-0
00:59:05.070 --> 00:59:07.384
Instructions, delivery
locations, and strike multiplier

9179f0d8-5fb1-413e-8c35-f79eabbfebe0-1
00:59:07.384 --> 00:59:09.865
price. Multiply the whole a
whole bunch of things with your

9179f0d8-5fb1-413e-8c35-f79eabbfebe0-2
00:59:09.865 --> 00:59:10.940
saw and that on that list.

209e72f0-8c1b-48f5-8cc8-0e558425724c-0
00:59:12.370 --> 00:59:15.626
And then once you have defined
that product, that product is

209e72f0-8c1b-48f5-8cc8-0e558425724c-1
00:59:15.626 --> 00:59:16.000
really.

69a41817-7e41-4392-8f6c-5d7b037e1daf-0
00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:20.660
In fact, it should really go the
opposite way.

278c5e21-e842-4490-91a2-0771090f8a1f-0
00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:22.320
A.

7786b03f-a59e-41ab-9543-3dab5b8e090b-0
00:59:26.030 --> 00:59:28.060
Exchange defines a product,
right?

2a020120-af0c-4f7a-bf92-c9fa9a78ad02-0
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:36.218
Yes, in the case of exchange
traded products, no in the case

2a020120-af0c-4f7a-bf92-c9fa9a78ad02-1
00:59:36.218 --> 00:59:36.950
of OTC products.

3d47e459-7d01-4cdb-9103-30e06f1646ee-0
00:59:37.870 --> 00:59:41.933
Unless you consider OTC to be an
exchange. You see? Yeah. Would

3d47e459-7d01-4cdb-9103-30e06f1646ee-1
00:59:41.933 --> 00:59:43.140
you see defines it.

7db3abb2-baa7-48a4-8753-b70b8c2a033f-0
00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:48.796
Like that's more of just like a
market convention. You know,

7db3abb2-baa7-48a4-8753-b70b8c2a033f-1
00:59:48.796 --> 00:59:52.564
like in the case of these
ethanol trades, if you're in the

7db3abb2-baa7-48a4-8753-b70b8c2a033f-2
00:59:52.564 --> 00:59:56.716
ethanol market and you say fuel
grade ethanol, there's sort of a

7db3abb2-baa7-48a4-8753-b70b8c2a033f-3
00:59:56.716 --> 01:00:00.740
common understanding of what you
mean. It's not defined by any

7db3abb2-baa7-48a4-8753-b70b8c2a033f-4
01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:01.889
particular entity.

b9776e5f-7ac2-407c-ac4e-c0d1fc5c4776-0
01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:05.761
Um. Although possibly in that
case it might be defined by

b9776e5f-7ac2-407c-ac4e-c0d1fc5c4776-1
01:00:05.761 --> 01:00:09.152
maybe the EPA or something. Or
USDA. But anyway, like it, you

b9776e5f-7ac2-407c-ac4e-c0d1fc5c4776-2
01:00:09.152 --> 01:00:11.886
know, it's it's not clear
exactly who defines it.

b9776e5f-7ac2-407c-ac4e-c0d1fc5c4776-3
01:00:11.886 --> 01:00:13.090
Sometimes it's just a.

03d685c5-d8cf-465f-a5cd-03df178058cd-0
01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:17.100
Market convention that is not
actually enforced by anyone.

b8e53424-2681-46de-91cc-550d1677e4ae-0
01:00:18.670 --> 01:00:21.190
Yeah, sort of coalesce around a
common definition.

5fbe2971-eff7-418b-888b-1277e2669e6b-0
01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:22.730
Yeah.

3d1c4e1a-26ff-44fe-90a9-c4d4d8531ee6-0
01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:29.063
But it it defines the
underlying, but there's also

3d1c4e1a-26ff-44fe-90a9-c4d4d8531ee6-1
01:00:29.063 --> 01:00:29.660
defining.

b021bbae-41bd-4a97-a237-988f65118d7c-0
01:00:30.410 --> 01:00:33.578
The contract specs right there.
Again, I'm using the word

b021bbae-41bd-4a97-a237-988f65118d7c-1
01:00:33.578 --> 01:00:36.800
contract generically, not a
lower case C, not an uppercase

b021bbae-41bd-4a97-a237-988f65118d7c-2
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:36.910
C.

fbb7b387-4388-48ef-af7c-72705422dc9b-0
01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:38.600
Umm.

c163eaed-4138-453b-8eb6-bd0e4ef9e592-0
01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:40.060
That.

67144ebd-1db7-4d5a-9f11-efd2c2a86326-0
01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:44.430
When you do an OTC, you have to
define.

7f6a79b3-f6e3-4603-bed3-73112bb28103-0
01:00:46.270 --> 01:00:47.920
Delivery locations.

edecc5eb-247a-46e9-bb07-2143193ae165-0
01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:51.020
And and some other things as
well, right? So there's.

9a1e0306-2679-4c34-93d9-923e1aa5206c-0
01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.175
You may not be officially
defining it, but you're

9a1e0306-2679-4c34-93d9-923e1aa5206c-1
01:00:54.175 --> 01:00:56.773
implicitly defining it. You're
defining the contract terms as

9a1e0306-2679-4c34-93d9-923e1aa5206c-2
01:00:56.773 --> 01:00:59.246
part of the product, and then
you have a financial support

9a1e0306-2679-4c34-93d9-923e1aa5206c-3
01:00:59.246 --> 01:01:00.210
that hangs off of that.

d6086c2d-a010-46d6-a7ce-7a49272e1980-0
01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:04.120
Yeah, I mean, it's not a great
way to model it here, but I.

93e037ca-928d-4769-b025-2c2991df4cee-0
01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:08.460
You OK. For the time being for
for OTC stuff like we would

93e037ca-928d-4769-b025-2c2991df4cee-1
01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.812
probably think about the product
as being something like fuel

93e037ca-928d-4769-b025-2c2991df4cee-2
01:01:11.812 --> 01:01:12.570
grade ethanol.

3d6a1768-fbe2-478b-86e9-37467511768d-0
01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:17.260
And then the instruments being
things like fuel grade ethanol

3d6a1768-fbe2-478b-86e9-37467511768d-1
01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:21.117
delivered in New York, fuel
grade ethanol delivered in Iowa,

3d6a1768-fbe2-478b-86e9-37467511768d-2
01:01:21.117 --> 01:01:24.341
fuel grade ethanol delivered
wherever there may be

3d6a1768-fbe2-478b-86e9-37467511768d-3
01:01:24.341 --> 01:01:25.480
differences about.

9b9ebe4b-6286-4ee6-93ff-d5f16a879d17-0
01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:27.470


e2b703f5-313b-471e-8dec-d8626a79e1a3-0
01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:33.196
Credit terms. There may be
differences about grade. There

e2b703f5-313b-471e-8dec-d8626a79e1a3-1
01:01:33.196 --> 01:01:34.910
may be differences about.

45d92788-2f05-4ee4-874c-2ad373ca99ab-0
01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:38.979
I don't know. I mean, we could
pull up our our tally tool and

45d92788-2f05-4ee4-874c-2ad373ca99ab-1
01:01:38.979 --> 01:01:40.700
show you all the bells and
whistles, but.

fdfa1369-c191-4dc5-8194-5e5453d7ffe9-0
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:42.140
Sort of.

4c052213-d3df-4988-b550-bfcd4912a21d-0
01:01:43.490 --> 01:01:44.860
Like the entirety.

8bf72169-5c05-4f3f-89fb-28ee29cea271-0
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:48.615
Of like everything you need to
know to understand what

8bf72169-5c05-4f3f-89fb-28ee29cea271-1
01:01:48.615 --> 01:01:51.614
everyone's business obligations
are like. That's what a

8bf72169-5c05-4f3f-89fb-28ee29cea271-2
01:01:51.614 --> 01:01:52.900
financial instrument is.

168abdef-b04b-42ab-95ad-9faa3fd46f5d-0
01:01:53.570 --> 01:01:56.601
And a product is, in a sense,
grouping financial instruments

168abdef-b04b-42ab-95ad-9faa3fd46f5d-1
01:01:56.601 --> 01:01:58.540
together that share common
properties.

051f6010-6677-4f49-929e-95bda7860a4d-0
01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.504
We just put this as a
placeholder for us to come back

051f6010-6677-4f49-929e-95bda7860a4d-1
01:02:05.504 --> 01:02:05.670
to.

f497ae2a-150d-4aa4-bd01-de9b72d3ac99-0
01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:09.930
Um.

6951e8b0-ff2c-4947-be78-2f864fd1a8cb-0
01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:13.170
Good model. Little differently
too.

e4e050b9-a72d-4ac5-b253-68a0777e4cc1-0
01:02:17.410 --> 01:02:19.800
Please, I'm gonna move these
things up here and move them

e4e050b9-a72d-4ac5-b253-68a0777e4cc1-1
01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:20.130
outside.

b7e604d2-3904-457f-8a6e-e30dfdb9622d-0
01:02:21.090 --> 01:02:21.710
Yeah, that's fine.

cde3fc88-1630-4530-9a8f-76aaf1c5a749-0
01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:27.410
So if we use.

56227941-6ca5-4e83-8431-cd43998fde79-0
01:02:30.610 --> 01:02:34.060
Yeah, I'm just gonna put in here
corn so I can, I can be.

3eb5dd88-14ea-4a91-af32-274380865ffe-0
01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:35.890
Use fewer words.

e0acf6f1-bc26-4ce6-903f-58eff768e203-0
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:44.050
If we take a corn option.

04ddc74b-6017-45c9-8324-392db63b5a09-0
01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:47.770
Corn option is a.

afb99341-c127-4f7d-8926-1885d87aa30e-0
01:02:48.790 --> 01:02:54.660
Option is defined by ice at a
certain attributes and then.

39a6c355-7c35-4a32-8797-a9b2ed5ed732-0
01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:56.370
Um.

4a70a44b-44b1-4cce-bdb9-17f78e868166-0
01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:58.050
Products.

2e0b661a-dac3-4335-aedd-15c65723d809-0
01:02:59.320 --> 01:02:59.880
As.

bf23c9a1-2581-4444-8c38-045585cc8eae-0
01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:02.210
Many.

44cc48eb-1edd-48ae-a747-807d24e2580d-0
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:04.660
Financial instruments.

5c2960e4-2e44-4742-ad67-9660da61ee2e-0
01:03:06.390 --> 01:03:08.849
And you take out the word
contract here because if you

5c2960e4-2e44-4742-ad67-9660da61ee2e-1
01:03:08.849 --> 01:03:10.460
just come up confuses a little
bit.

3c86fb55-0233-45f7-93ed-5b0c5f2fdaf4-0
01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:12.650
And that.

2a3c0d05-3baf-4d18-bea8-b0f024be3726-0
01:03:14.990 --> 01:03:16.980
You know what we don't need this
here than anymore, do we?

f6654b7d-6982-49e5-a027-e5e7ce567ee5-0
01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:20.866
Because by definition, the
financial instrument is a

f6654b7d-6982-49e5-a027-e5e7ce567ee5-1
01:03:20.866 --> 01:03:23.820
product belongs to a product
which is on the exchange.

da646416-7881-434e-93b7-4b3f05994ab2-0
01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:25.800
Yeah.

f050c2e8-2fb9-4fd3-9fe8-f92d921eb921-0
01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.550
Yeah. So we can move that.

af201781-69ce-4130-b929-13a1fe3c9592-0
01:03:32.110 --> 01:03:35.150
That would still work if an
instrument has attributes.

ef7d14af-454f-4bb3-82fa-110ad8892135-0
01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:42.100
The financial instrument rolls
up into an option group.

bfe68c40-bbb7-4cfa-8f42-b6380895a504-0
01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:46.408
Yeah, because you would have
weekly options that roll up.

bfe68c40-bbb7-4cfa-8f42-b6380895a504-1
01:03:46.408 --> 01:03:49.407
Yeah, it does. But by way of
product, financial statements

bfe68c40-bbb7-4cfa-8f42-b6380895a504-2
01:03:49.407 --> 01:03:52.305
will pop into a product which
then roll up into adoption

bfe68c40-bbb7-4cfa-8f42-b6380895a504-3
01:03:52.305 --> 01:03:52.610
group.

af1b0340-b823-4678-93ed-438600cba40b-0
01:03:54.870 --> 01:03:57.415
But I think we're covered there
because the product has many

af1b0340-b823-4678-93ed-438600cba40b-1
01:03:57.415 --> 01:03:59.918
financial instruments and the
financial instrument rolls up

af1b0340-b823-4678-93ed-438600cba40b-2
01:03:59.918 --> 01:04:02.380
into a product group. So if we
walk it, we should be good.

93b89819-de42-40a5-87fc-e6dd99d78758-0
01:04:05.330 --> 01:04:09.840
Yeah. But Scott, in your example
or whatever, the product example

93b89819-de42-40a5-87fc-e6dd99d78758-1
01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:13.873
would be Casey hard red wheat
futures and then KC hard red

93b89819-de42-40a5-87fc-e6dd99d78758-2
01:04:13.873 --> 01:04:15.650
wheat like weekly options.

a3b88038-2425-4a67-b6a7-ddbe31ad6b8c-0
01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:20.070
Right. Yeah, it's it's a product
group, isn't it?

2b07fb1d-01cc-423a-8fac-c0da1e8a209d-0
01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:21.140
Yeah.

2eda439b-53bd-4255-862a-39e0f61931c8-0
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:27.120
Should that be hung off the
product?

d6bcd51a-2f44-4bce-934b-d61f8a59c1de-0
01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:33.660
But the instruments roll up into
a product group, right?

3a2875bf-b389-4fc9-8f31-34a671567bc5-0
01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:38.251
But indirectly, first they roll
up into a product, and products

3a2875bf-b389-4fc9-8f31-34a671567bc5-1
01:04:38.251 --> 01:04:39.480
roll up into a product group.

ccde61c8-d4e5-4fa2-bdbb-b3c08e3ee840-0
01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:45.970
Or do you mean like?

f3cf714d-fb29-49ca-9979-679d11986ff0-0
01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.470
Like these kind of product
groups like AG.

c81c33a9-4034-46a8-971e-26d953b40ff5-0
01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.310
No. Grain grains? No so.

f441c1b6-50cc-4ec1-b330-2c578826845f-0
01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.200
If you go back to that page.

a3edae0e-3181-4bda-8264-6e0f838a9fb0-0
01:04:58.890 --> 01:04:59.780
Search corn.

e82b5ccf-9351-41b8-bb78-25d54b6115ba-0
01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:01.830


8a765de2-decb-45bc-b0ba-7758560e57d1-0
01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.950
So corn options.

c053a5b1-d2ea-4785-99b0-f1f2d672b457-0
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:12.816

c053a5b1-d2ea-4785-99b0-f1f2d672b457-1
01:05:12.816 --> 01:05:14.300
corn Weekly Options Week 3.

401705aa-019d-4552-a425-642d51740739-0
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:17.390
Short dated new crop corn
options.

935b85e9-a671-425a-bbbb-9126abae0072-0
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:20.610
Short dated corn options.

6353399b-baa1-4ee4-b551-9a4cf896a94f-0
01:05:22.140 --> 01:05:23.740
Those are all in the same option
group.

9f812059-945a-404b-81fe-051e9c5320c3-0
01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:31.573
Corn distillate CSO is not in
the same option group, but it's

9f812059-945a-404b-81fe-051e9c5320c3-1
01:05:31.573 --> 01:05:35.427
in the same option group as the
corn in March, July CSO the

9f812059-945a-404b-81fe-051e9c5320c3-2
01:05:35.427 --> 01:05:38.190
corn, July D CSO the corn
consecutive CSO.

fb9e68f8-885f-4815-a21a-499d2a197f5d-0
01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:40.520
Etcetera.

bfb4982d-33a1-4ccb-a8fe-f74d75cfc2b0-0
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:45.600
Processing what you're saying.

e7d95d92-3c0a-4757-bb22-f5d308c5b748-0
01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.008
So this corn weekly options,
week one is a different product

e7d95d92-3c0a-4757-bb22-f5d308c5b748-1
01:05:56.008 --> 01:05:57.310
than corn options.

f93f727c-1e8b-4045-b3bc-dae354e4c4de-0
01:05:59.510 --> 01:06:01.140
Because there's different
definitions here.

45a5ff28-2526-4f89-85da-32960db163f1-0
01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.710
Yeah, different product
attributions.

8ae4f4a6-ec4d-493e-9f79-46167c878b7d-0
01:06:05.490 --> 01:06:09.480
OK, so then I get it. So.

f8e7e34a-1fdd-4379-8027-293bda1e98d6-0
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:12.620
This rolls up.

31fc0b79-5c7d-469e-8cd5-33ad5bfa180f-0
01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:15.740
Into a product group.

a0555710-e75b-4694-b11b-ce6229165156-0
01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:19.927
It might be worth pointing out
there that we diverge from the

a0555710-e75b-4694-b11b-ce6229165156-1
01:06:19.927 --> 01:06:21.180
CME terminology at that point.

0ad8f4e3-cc33-4fca-977b-2ae3edb7039c-0
01:06:22.550 --> 01:06:24.888
If you go back into that thing,
you can see that they call

0ad8f4e3-cc33-4fca-977b-2ae3edb7039c-1
01:06:24.888 --> 01:06:25.840
something product group.

0c9fe1e8-7a86-4ca0-80ca-ce02c1e75166-0
01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:30.610
I would just. I would usually
call that a complex.

d443e3c7-e20a-469d-9c0f-9536788d7da5-0
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:34.620
This one here is it. Is it.
Grain is a complex.

5b075f8d-056b-4263-9f74-56094c4e2d73-0
01:06:36.030 --> 01:06:39.936
I mean, specifically, I think I
would call that a subcomplex.

5b075f8d-056b-4263-9f74-56094c4e2d73-1
01:06:39.936 --> 01:06:42.520
The complex is aggs subcomplexes
grains.

4e647239-9a61-44af-a19b-82b6cd784920-0
01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:44.930
The sub sub complex is corn.

dac5490a-6c32-4fe8-818a-b79ba2ed6583-0
01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:49.390
And then say.

e445123c-0c01-46fd-a114-880f8076270c-0
01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:54.209
You know, US corn would be one
thing. Black Sea corn would be

e445123c-0c01-46fd-a114-880f8076270c-1
01:06:54.209 --> 01:06:55.110
another thing.

6611f511-784c-4fad-86bc-c950be3849f9-0
01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:58.750
They're all on that sub
subcomplex Black Sea corn.

1485826c-3212-4e2f-b92a-98ce913c51af-0
01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:01.490
Oh, that's my newest favorite
commodity.

0587f5a9-3e7c-463f-9c06-e4b7bb40bcc0-0
01:07:04.690 --> 01:07:07.310
Frank made-up his own earlier
today. No, he didn't.

f18feb5c-ded3-4e58-9131-0a25bb36bdcd-0
01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.650
Those are real. Is that even
actually one? Let me see.

c18797bf-da94-47a2-9171-895ebcf8f0eb-0
01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:14.994
Uh, there's Black Sea wheat. I
think I might have that wrong. I

c18797bf-da94-47a2-9171-895ebcf8f0eb-1
01:07:14.994 --> 01:07:15.960
might actually be black.

87092fe6-2c33-438f-adc3-5312246e7b49-0
01:07:16.850 --> 01:07:18.330
Yeah, flexicorn alright.

b53b4182-18ff-445c-b00c-f1d4cdec17c8-0
01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:22.200
Would you call a a complex?

05071b65-21e4-4362-bc8a-da0f64805a45-0
01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.890
Yeah, I'll put this up here. We
don't have to.

c5176067-04fe-420d-9b1e-bacded4ab70d-0
01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:29.616
For our purposes, as long as we
all understand what we're

c5176067-04fe-420d-9b1e-bacded4ab70d-1
01:07:29.616 --> 01:07:31.630
talking about when we talk about
a product group.

4741e082-952c-497c-a541-30f9213fa4e4-0
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:36.504
That we're not talking about it
at the grain level and I usually

4741e082-952c-497c-a541-30f9213fa4e4-1
01:07:36.504 --> 01:07:39.767
consider those complex things to
be like attributes of the

4741e082-952c-497c-a541-30f9213fa4e4-2
01:07:39.767 --> 01:07:40.210
product.

3971b984-5bc3-4df7-85fd-04545623fbab-0
01:07:41.930 --> 01:07:45.267
And so they're not really their
own standalone entities that

3971b984-5bc3-4df7-85fd-04545623fbab-1
01:07:45.267 --> 01:07:48.440
have their own like other
properties. They're just groups

3971b984-5bc3-4df7-85fd-04545623fbab-2
01:07:48.440 --> 01:07:51.668
that are sometimes useful to
group things for UI purposes,

3971b984-5bc3-4df7-85fd-04545623fbab-3
01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:52.380
for instance.

abb0850d-d28f-47bc-98b7-16887db7915a-0
01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:57.754
And so like contract date kind
of also works that same way.

abb0850d-d28f-47bc-98b7-16887db7915a-1
01:07:57.754 --> 01:08:01.360
Contract date is a property of
the financial instrument.

40c7f97e-a721-41ec-a44e-9f2c109030ba-0
01:08:02.050 --> 01:08:03.890
A lot of times you might want to
roll up.

dfc184e8-e1f7-4788-927e-ac39a6d1a3e2-0
01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:07.766
Sort of group things by contract
date. You know you want to look

dfc184e8-e1f7-4788-927e-ac39a6d1a3e2-1
01:08:07.766 --> 01:08:08.140
at all the.

beb0299d-74b8-4ad5-a279-5dc19a8aacd3-0
01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.987
June corn options and ignore the
dec corn options for the time

beb0299d-74b8-4ad5-a279-5dc19a8aacd3-1
01:08:12.987 --> 01:08:13.360
being.

c80535e4-5394-4f27-8965-fd24e6984f88-0
01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:16.620
So they sort of also work as a
grouping.

cb85cce1-8f59-4609-b4e5-0cd2ef09cc5c-0
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:24.350
So what was Grains was the.

adfa4f34-defb-4253-8367-1fd708bbfd9c-0
01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.567
This this is the agriculture is
the complex grains and sub

adfa4f34-defb-4253-8367-1fd708bbfd9c-1
01:08:28.567 --> 01:08:30.750
complex and then corns are sub
sub complex.

9fe719f3-a242-42f2-998f-b87b16b3015e-0
01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:34.930
But that's entirely arbitrary. I
just literally made that up

9fe719f3-a242-42f2-998f-b87b16b3015e-1
01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:36.520
myself because that's what I
wanted.

18a7c3f1-838b-4087-b748-e1040011b864-0
01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:38.300
Umm.

6b3262d1-db8b-457f-853a-790783df4bdb-0
01:08:40.090 --> 01:08:41.320
Let's do.

707f911a-9463-42f2-bf03-e527309a7388-0
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:44.610
Complex.

f24cf8b3-1e66-4c4d-ace7-859e015f42a7-0
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:46.010
And.

2ad13284-9f40-4ab5-9ca3-10f0e08001f7-0
01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:54.610
Uh.

1cbccf44-08c3-4524-9d47-9424f6c56f40-0
01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:14.810
Get rid of that.

48b17b24-f49f-4015-bc50-7f619c5e0489-0
01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:21.930
That probably belongs over here
somewhere.

4f4fbd8b-0f49-44d1-a3e7-b49ce20b95db-0
01:09:23.770 --> 01:09:25.880
But a product group?

52628831-fd88-4ca7-8bd8-9339d428d2e4-0
01:09:29.010 --> 01:09:30.220
Is.

9f72257e-c84c-438f-bb4b-fb783d99d8cd-0
01:09:36.700 --> 01:09:38.090
The example of there.

6549f340-9bc2-4b73-b7eb-efd4053bb59a-0
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:39.900
But.

c8048197-2b73-4bcf-bb67-8a0cd1725587-0
01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:55.610
Is that corn? Is that the
example you want to use?

5988e65b-b280-42d8-b2f1-44e0b2b8078d-0
01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:03.096
Yeah, like you said, some of
these would roll like like corn

5988e65b-b280-42d8-b2f1-44e0b2b8078d-1
01:10:03.096 --> 01:10:04.350
weekly options 123.

f5d798bd-e735-4707-b39d-7205d24f643c-0
01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:10.370
Yeah, and so that again is not
an officially defined exchange.

8e4ab4d0-152b-4813-8172-8bc22ce9328a-0
01:10:11.850 --> 01:10:14.791
Like terminology, it's just my
own, so I call it whatever I

8e4ab4d0-152b-4813-8172-8bc22ce9328a-1
01:10:14.791 --> 01:10:16.360
want. So I would call that corn.

1116a8d0-8bcb-41eb-a16a-426a74a32b3d-0
01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:22.789
OK. So like the the the ones
there essentially would be in I

1116a8d0-8bcb-41eb-a16a-426a74a32b3d-1
01:10:22.789 --> 01:10:23.200
think?

01695e29-d657-4b87-973d-a6be7a0e39e9-0
01:10:25.490 --> 01:10:26.260
Uh.

90956b6f-e1cd-4188-80ce-bb64dd5bac9a-0
01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:30.408
Maybe three different product
groups. There'd be the sort of

90956b6f-e1cd-4188-80ce-bb64dd5bac9a-1
01:10:30.408 --> 01:10:31.020
corn options.

b4cb0f9d-cb7c-42ec-8d39-76923b58c2cf-0
01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:33.450
There'd be corn Csos.

417bfb6a-0a8d-4954-ad0b-9bf7afe3675f-0
01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:37.267
And then I think there are a
couple of other products that

417bfb6a-0a8d-4954-ad0b-9bf7afe3675f-1
01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:40.231
didn't fit into those, like
there was the Black Sea corn and

417bfb6a-0a8d-4954-ad0b-9bf7afe3675f-2
01:10:40.231 --> 01:10:42.710
I think the corn futures don't
really have groups.

c9ae5780-baa0-417e-8d80-087568f41c4e-0
01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:44.560
Futures don't have groups.

0e045ed7-9e6c-4488-ad9a-39935cf5fe23-0
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:48.230
At least not yet.

2b72c55f-e0ed-4d8d-94d9-f3dcb1e2623b-0
01:10:58.940 --> 01:10:59.300
OK.

4592dffb-03b7-4c92-a52c-3ce6f6d9d7bc-0
01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:04.083
And really it would be black
scene corn futures or Black Sea

4592dffb-03b7-4c92-a52c-3ce6f6d9d7bc-1
01:11:04.083 --> 01:11:04.860
corn options.

3ef30e2e-ae5b-4f4c-8011-dddc3f53e034-0
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:09.426
Or no options, I guess because
we don't have groups of futures.

3ef30e2e-ae5b-4f4c-8011-dddc3f53e034-1
01:11:09.426 --> 01:11:09.670
Sorry.

7f4608c7-b243-414f-92b7-7e27f0a1b717-0
01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:23.480
Sure.

93fe856b-0290-477b-9a48-6d1c1b964761-0
01:11:36.930 --> 01:11:39.774
Market information then is
market information more for

93fe856b-0290-477b-9a48-6d1c1b964761-1
01:11:39.774 --> 01:11:40.860
financial instrument?

3ff62a79-fc6a-4321-bf0c-80e552ce7d39-0
01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:46.650
And that was the stuff that I
put there that.

fdb00be8-0b14-4a94-ab6e-9c55ae719610-0
01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.902
The information that you're
getting from TT, the live stuff

fdb00be8-0b14-4a94-ab6e-9c55ae719610-1
01:11:49.902 --> 01:11:51.640
that was showing on the vault
dashboard.

e383cf0b-7080-4233-aaf1-322ef4a0fb0b-0
01:11:52.930 --> 01:11:56.060
That was where that came from.
Market data. That's OK.

39667f5e-6cb2-46f7-b9ed-9ad3db3e8bca-0
01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:14.745
Yeah. And I mean that's sort of
conventional, you know, it's

39667f5e-6cb2-46f7-b9ed-9ad3db3e8bca-1
01:12:14.745 --> 01:12:17.716
just particular attributes of a
financial instrument that

39667f5e-6cb2-46f7-b9ed-9ad3db3e8bca-2
01:12:17.716 --> 01:12:18.690
changed frequently.

a224b677-259c-4c96-8010-c9a63dc2e23e-0
01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:20.510
Umm.

1b52b53f-9e34-469b-a812-1bc0a401cdf9-0
01:12:24.190 --> 01:12:27.573
There's like the dynamic and
there's like the static static

1b52b53f-9e34-469b-a812-1bc0a401cdf9-1
01:12:27.573 --> 01:12:28.250
data, right?

a85dc673-59cc-4f0a-907a-b10fc0eb76ad-0
01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:32.620
Yeah, I don't know if that's
what you want and product data

a85dc673-59cc-4f0a-907a-b10fc0eb76ad-1
01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:36.097
or I'm thinking santistevan
financial instrument attributes.

a85dc673-59cc-4f0a-907a-b10fc0eb76ad-2
01:12:36.097 --> 01:12:38.890
Is that what you're thinking?
Yeah, that's fine.

ffb48a36-988a-4bec-be89-86acccb80e02-0
01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:43.378
And and where I made the
distinction, I put both of them

ffb48a36-988a-4bec-be89-86acccb80e02-1
01:12:43.378 --> 01:12:46.286
on here because I knew we would
have to talk about them. The

ffb48a36-988a-4bec-be89-86acccb80e02-2
01:12:46.286 --> 01:12:49.386
market date of the intent there
was the stuff that's coming from

ffb48a36-988a-4bec-be89-86acccb80e02-3
01:12:49.386 --> 01:12:52.104
to you from TT that you're
showing on the Val dashboard.

ffb48a36-988a-4bec-be89-86acccb80e02-4
01:12:52.104 --> 01:12:54.869
The other one was the spam data
that you're getting from.

fbd9a210-6d4d-4a2d-9532-d6f426103c82-0
01:12:55.700 --> 01:12:58.521
It's that you get to get from a
text file or it's a text file

fbd9a210-6d4d-4a2d-9532-d6f426103c82-1
01:12:58.521 --> 01:13:01.433
that you're getting. So I think
that would Mike is where you're

fbd9a210-6d4d-4a2d-9532-d6f426103c82-2
01:13:01.433 --> 01:13:02.890
going with the more static data.

19159942-22d0-4828-8f30-bdfd6884e708-0
01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:09.055
Uh, no. The more sake it is like
the strike, which doesn't change

19159942-22d0-4828-8f30-bdfd6884e708-1
01:13:09.055 --> 01:13:13.216
for a financial instrument
expiration date, which doesn't

19159942-22d0-4828-8f30-bdfd6884e708-2
01:13:13.216 --> 01:13:16.660
change for for particular
financial instrument.

a19690a7-23f7-49be-8dfe-94a02ace1048-0
01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:21.162
Yeah, so this is another area
where it's fairly context

a19690a7-23f7-49be-8dfe-94a02ace1048-1
01:13:21.162 --> 01:13:23.580
dependent. Like these terms,
they're overloaded.

c9bcd007-64fc-4621-a9fc-3d2d64bfb74b-0
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:28.556
So, like probably most of the
time when someone says market

c9bcd007-64fc-4621-a9fc-3d2d64bfb74b-1
01:13:28.556 --> 01:13:30.240
data, they're talking about.

a42b9027-b38f-4361-93a2-86618288ac68-0
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:34.650
Like stuff that changes quickly,
which would be like.

eb8acc9d-7748-4654-9045-647219663237-0
01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:39.531
The best bid price the best ask
price. The size of the best bid

eb8acc9d-7748-4654-9045-647219663237-1
01:13:39.531 --> 01:13:42.894
price the size of the best ask
price. They might give you the

eb8acc9d-7748-4654-9045-647219663237-2
01:13:42.894 --> 01:13:45.769
level two data. They might give
you the entire book.

d411074b-98a3-4c5c-bef7-6a174f3581cb-0
01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:51.876
However, that's like the most
common, but also many exchange

d411074b-98a3-4c5c-bef7-6a174f3581cb-1
01:13:51.876 --> 01:13:55.470
market data systems also give
you the static data too.

33f1a7ef-4488-454d-8950-765d25ef8bf5-0
01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:03.913
And then there's also stuff that
I would call market data that is

33f1a7ef-4488-454d-8950-765d25ef8bf5-1
01:14:03.913 --> 01:14:07.710
associated with a product. So
for instance, the.

f034b8ec-0e9e-4a4b-8c98-a4ad271c81aa-0
01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.270
Contracts.

177b7470-9ee0-466a-bd35-2e785ba015dd-0
01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:13.980
The contract dates that are
listed for a future product.

e5eb0685-8b2d-412c-ba12-0f30749c89a5-0
01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:19.746
I would probably call that
market data and that that's the,

e5eb0685-8b2d-412c-ba12-0f30749c89a5-1
01:14:19.746 --> 01:14:23.053
that's actually what we're
getting out of that span file is

e5eb0685-8b2d-412c-ba12-0f30749c89a5-2
01:14:23.053 --> 01:14:26.360
which contracts, which contract
dates exist and then which.

cc7a91e4-f937-4394-a034-f982feacd20e-0
01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.580
Contracts dates.

ff991031-a5d4-44f2-95ef-3c50be62f5e6-0
01:14:31.070 --> 01:14:33.750
Strikes and writes exist for.

032e0c0f-a2cc-4c83-99f3-b3289e543c72-0
01:14:34.510 --> 01:14:35.120
Options.

fe106058-dacf-4a59-a725-110d1102d0bc-0
01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:52.250
So what if we?

a9e88351-6f32-43cf-907f-c3ddb4f93016-0
01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.809
I don't want to get too much
into what comes from T, it comes

a9e88351-6f32-43cf-907f-c3ddb4f93016-1
01:14:56.809 --> 01:14:57.250
from span.

310ecbbf-c78c-47b2-a1e2-6f9526f0cc48-0
01:14:57.960 --> 01:14:59.790
But I I am with you that.

995e3f0e-7144-4dd8-b221-e3d96e196b73-0
01:15:03.630 --> 01:15:04.790
These are both.

75147c49-f705-43be-9c8c-87bdf3c985f2-0
01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:06.910
Umm.

780737c4-218c-430b-8b11-b4b7dfb254b5-0
01:15:13.190 --> 01:15:14.820
How is someone calling me on
zoom?

0592913e-5505-4964-8618-03b748f5f0eb-0
01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:21.080


149dafae-46aa-423d-af2e-ddc825999eaf-0
01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:26.420
So.

98ae12e5-2fad-4180-9854-d5650f9bf9d0-0
01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:31.455
Yeah, I don't know if there's
like a fuzzy line or something,

98ae12e5-2fad-4180-9854-d5650f9bf9d0-1
01:15:31.455 --> 01:15:35.117
but yeah, I'm totally, I'm
totally with you about a fuzzy

98ae12e5-2fad-4180-9854-d5650f9bf9d0-2
01:15:35.117 --> 01:15:38.780
line. Exactly where I was going.
Just like like a like a.

7a39b78d-ebcf-4b55-8445-43c486218c27-0
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:43.190
So one of them for like a.

2717f3d0-9c07-4d2f-b3ea-9917e47acd48-0
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:50.268
Sexually section differentiate
or something like that. Yeah,

2717f3d0-9c07-4d2f-b3ea-9917e47acd48-1
01:15:50.268 --> 01:15:54.483
like, yeah, like generally
speaking, you can kind of group

2717f3d0-9c07-4d2f-b3ea-9917e47acd48-2
01:15:54.483 --> 01:15:58.699
the stuff into highly dynamic
attributes and fairly static

2717f3d0-9c07-4d2f-b3ea-9917e47acd48-3
01:15:58.699 --> 01:16:01.700
attributes. The line is not
always clean.

ec5b40ff-4940-4728-8c71-ecaf80ca769f-0
01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:05.930
And the technology that you use
to pull them?

6df57a02-bf56-4ff4-be9c-1d818b99ce80-0
01:16:06.650 --> 01:16:08.340
Might also cross those
categories.

1f726e6c-b0ae-43e1-b7a9-6601806f8eb8-0
01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:19.700
Is your kid looking kid here?

9c441508-1f38-49ac-9a2b-c748c76ca39e-0
01:16:22.290 --> 01:16:23.340
What are you looking for?

1b61669a-fb37-4f8f-a6ce-60610cb699ca-0
01:16:24.970 --> 01:16:25.480
OK.

8dfdf535-23b5-46d6-bbad-1cdd03ab4b39-0
01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:44.938
Possibly slightly too pedantic,
but we don't get the vols from

8dfdf535-23b5-46d6-bbad-1cdd03ab4b39-1
01:16:44.938 --> 01:16:46.670
TT, we calculate those
ourselves.

fc665b19-8124-4b09-b642-09314d2503b9-0
01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.630
You calculate the vols yourself.

9648639d-85bd-4a10-bbf0-e962a59c03fe-0
01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:58.010
Get some sort of a library for
that. Yep. Or do you?

17ea46b4-f734-4f36-b7fd-9cfc1d67d16d-0
01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:03.340
We could probably do at the
money balls.

0f22122a-d9df-4087-ac80-2dacb97d747e-0
01:17:04.450 --> 01:17:07.166
Just implied balls just by
backing the black Scholes,

0f22122a-d9df-4087-ac80-2dacb97d747e-1
01:17:07.166 --> 01:17:07.720
right, but.

4c438897-4eea-4cd4-9d00-4de5960cec88-0
01:17:08.630 --> 01:17:13.038
Well, they're American options,
so you need to use a tree

4c438897-4eea-4cd4-9d00-4de5960cec88-1
01:17:13.038 --> 01:17:13.570
pricer.

3e009131-af45-48e8-bde7-42ff6f89cf3f-0
01:17:14.420 --> 01:17:15.590
We use Eliza and Rhymer tree.

647fb1b6-6737-4185-a0b6-a0fb1b2510d8-0
01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:16.730
OK.

033da0c7-0440-41a5-a2e3-49d9bc757c17-0
01:17:24.910 --> 01:17:25.570
That's pretty fun.

2a57a61d-042a-43c6-8c19-37d5583dacd7-0
01:17:26.450 --> 01:17:29.307
And then you got to run it
through a root Finder and

2a57a61d-042a-43c6-8c19-37d5583dacd7-1
01:17:29.307 --> 01:17:31.140
optimizer and solve the
equation.

6a6c34d9-c116-4a5d-b6fc-93986ae262f2-0
01:17:33.710 --> 01:17:35.080
You know, just use Excel solver.

b68d57ef-0ab7-4b6a-8b82-3601103ec4e5-0
01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:37.580
I do not.

7aeb6493-3dac-4ed1-9df0-75925ff144e7-0
01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:42.951
Listen, if it were up to me, it
would be through Excel, but it's

7aeb6493-3dac-4ed1-9df0-75925ff144e7-1
01:17:42.951 --> 01:17:45.680
not. The Excel solver is
actually excellent.

ccb31a04-9b13-4c20-b1d2-c4e419485e0d-0
01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:50.100
It's probably the best.

0b7dc258-6b01-49ec-bc34-a2edff467ffd-0
01:17:54.010 --> 01:17:57.398
Derivative free optimizer I've
ever seen as far as just like

0b7dc258-6b01-49ec-bc34-a2edff467ffd-1
01:17:57.398 --> 01:17:58.010
robustness.

b2e4c340-955d-4440-8306-67965218daf5-0
01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:03.962
It's amazing how long it's been
out too. I mean, that's been out

b2e4c340-955d-4440-8306-67965218daf5-1
01:18:03.962 --> 01:18:05.030
since like early 90s.

cb87bb4f-c157-42a5-8cd4-4c615eece3e6-0
01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:07.610
Umm.

ca100cd2-e22d-4167-ae21-35b6d921f37f-0
01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:11.491
It's a different problem class,
though. That's sort of a

ca100cd2-e22d-4167-ae21-35b6d921f37f-1
01:18:11.491 --> 01:18:14.525
constrained minimization
problem. Is what that's good

ca100cd2-e22d-4167-ae21-35b6d921f37f-2
01:18:14.525 --> 01:18:14.750
for.

2a4b192e-a56c-406c-b4e0-6125bd60a0d4-0
01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:17.230
Whereas this is root finding.

605c8b94-ed81-4034-b1d4-423ad5fba5de-0
01:18:19.410 --> 01:18:21.920
And it's performance critical
code, so it needs to be fast.

26dc649e-393a-4c10-a9b6-def893ff0b07-0
01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.500
Andrew, we're wheezing on.

ccd60132-8f7b-490a-a6d5-3b84349c5fe4-0
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:33.800
Our last project did calculate
all services QOQ net.

1bf058d2-ef50-455b-9ae5-25ac5e5303da-0
01:18:34.490 --> 01:18:34.990
Yeah.

8aefe737-0489-4890-b476-97462d86ccb9-0
01:18:37.150 --> 01:18:39.820
Yeah, that's what they're that's
what they're moving into.

29bcf80a-e8ba-43cf-ae53-7ac3e8533525-0
01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:48.500
I'm thinking some of this might
need a little.

d742ad65-f4f9-4150-9da6-2781591e5ef1-0
01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:55.360
Section as well.

1f2b9b30-fd30-4b32-a88b-a54c7a25dbaa-0
01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:02.330
With attributes maybe with
product type over here?

e25a787a-554c-4647-9021-300f15208463-0
01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:13.640
Want to clean all this up what
Denise was saying earlier?

7ebf568e-6a15-4302-bdc2-9fb95429f25b-0
01:19:20.090 --> 01:19:20.960
Oh, that's a cool.

37f46404-8eff-4b4f-91c5-95e7981fb8db-0
01:19:21.890 --> 01:19:22.760
Looping around.

598f13f2-f407-4f76-ad3e-33df66963cf6-0
01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:26.530
All this stuff.

b75803d3-16d9-4081-8d07-ce01158de905-0
01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:45.570
Do we need product data here
anymore? Because it seems like.

e6e0e6d2-b802-4457-828d-9a51dd2e8ff4-0
01:19:47.190 --> 01:19:48.580
All this is kind of product
data.

78fea8fc-10cd-42a0-b46b-140b5ccfacd0-0
01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:53.852
We need to have something that
indicates that we're getting

78fea8fc-10cd-42a0-b46b-140b5ccfacd0-1
01:19:53.852 --> 01:19:56.720
that text file because it's it's
data that's coming in.

26b510bb-f529-450b-beeb-fad63bf18a63-0
01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:58.530
External.

3168cdd2-d528-4dcd-bb93-be08774df402-0
01:20:00.010 --> 01:20:02.590
To Stag, as long as we're
covered there.

e53baa9d-5d24-4557-903f-43430c00190d-0
01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.846
Some of it is actually external,
and some of it is actually

e53baa9d-5d24-4557-903f-43430c00190d-1
01:20:06.846 --> 01:20:08.190
calculated at algorithmically.

7b24efce-189b-41c6-a230-196f537c203b-0
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:12.870
That this was to denote the tax
file that's coming in.

6ad6c3b5-98f3-431e-bf11-ce35f3394ce7-0
01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:18.132
Yeah, but I'm, I'm wondering if
if you know if we get market

6ad6c3b5-98f3-431e-bf11-ce35f3394ce7-1
01:20:18.132 --> 01:20:20.995
data, let's take market data as
an example, if we could market

6ad6c3b5-98f3-431e-bf11-ce35f3394ce7-2
01:20:20.995 --> 01:20:21.450
data from.

fbbe2561-098b-4bbf-8d20-557ab3ffebfc-0
01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:25.400
Source A and we go from source
B, then give them source C.

e59e3844-61c5-425e-8a12-21df8d4ff035-0
01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:28.561
Does that change the domain
model much because they're still

e59e3844-61c5-425e-8a12-21df8d4ff035-1
01:20:28.561 --> 01:20:29.290
getting market data.

e48a5c90-e434-46a3-ae0c-9f7f7cad28cd-0
01:20:31.160 --> 01:20:33.726
It doesn't really change the
domain model. I would I would

e48a5c90-e434-46a3-ae0c-9f7f7cad28cd-1
01:20:33.726 --> 01:20:33.900
say.

a237216b-d536-43f6-8ded-5652a70e33f8-0
01:20:36.230 --> 01:20:39.105
And when we get through a text
file or an API, it's become more

a237216b-d536-43f6-8ded-5652a70e33f8-1
01:20:39.105 --> 01:20:39.780
implementation.

4efe0f28-23ab-4a6a-8314-4fbfd1c3853a-0
01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:43.630
Who's moving this me?

92311e2a-485a-47fd-8f06-b21fdc535645-0
01:20:46.020 --> 01:20:46.840
It's like moving.

84ed8112-82be-4d91-946b-4037bc466662-0
01:20:48.670 --> 01:20:49.430
Not even touch it.

99159120-709c-4bb4-8aa3-f0cc7e2f5f9b-0
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.880
It's.

ef27a518-1bed-47ab-88a4-441f04d2ba1a-0
01:20:56.860 --> 01:20:59.380
So I'm kind of looking at this
as being.

81307338-4b76-4e64-9ffb-793e59107a2a-0
01:21:01.820 --> 01:21:03.110
Put text in here, Denise.

0d6e3667-3a4e-4b0d-96ca-bbc70022e177-0
01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.711
Sorry, real quick. Can you kill
the link between a client desk

0d6e3667-3a4e-4b0d-96ca-bbc70022e177-1
01:21:11.711 --> 01:21:12.380
and product?

ddebba2d-b1bf-4dca-a853-841755204250-0
01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:18.201
Yeah, I was looking at that too.
Let me say, let me just put the

ddebba2d-b1bf-4dca-a853-841755204250-1
01:21:18.201 --> 01:21:18.650
a note.

da935bad-42c0-4b40-a0a8-8bbe640fbaae-0
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:22.140
You can put just a purely text
in here.

48dbaf3a-fbf6-40ad-9157-6cd0de3cd3f3-0
01:21:23.690 --> 01:21:23.990
Off.

7144c013-cf82-4dcc-be4a-12c5dfdefb88-0
01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:27.210
Yeah.

32ea16dc-a0bd-4ec1-be9d-2e412993a1ea-0
01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:37.730
I mean collectively we would
call this product data.

205742db-4177-4ef9-ac7f-4222d9b792c7-0
01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:45.250
And I think collectively we
would call this.

d3d5724b-564b-4a83-a7a1-ba248265929e-0
01:21:48.290 --> 01:21:49.280
Market data.

cca41888-290a-4978-a6a3-b793863ddb92-0
01:21:52.530 --> 01:21:54.680
We can. We can refine that, but.

293d2242-0b11-4c7b-99b5-0dcb928845de-0
01:21:58.750 --> 01:22:03.630
Yeah. So yeah. You said. Yeah.
Yeah. OK, good.

968db0c6-7a33-49f1-a6e9-d7813149d9d5-0
01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.640
So a client has many.

b3ab6eb3-5dbc-4878-90c1-3ead7209dfd6-0
01:22:11.370 --> 01:22:12.420
Desks.

92234395-69a1-40df-840b-0637bd470457-0
01:22:13.410 --> 01:22:17.381
Wait, hang on. Sorry. So market
data, so just to run sabate

92234395-69a1-40df-840b-0637bd470457-1
01:22:17.381 --> 01:22:21.486
market data is just anything
that defines or any attribute of

92234395-69a1-40df-840b-0637bd470457-2
01:22:21.486 --> 01:22:25.458
a financial instrument and
product data as any attribute of

92234395-69a1-40df-840b-0637bd470457-3
01:22:25.458 --> 01:22:26.120
a product?

400bd168-2f78-4ff1-84f5-c13bd0e8e232-0
01:22:27.210 --> 01:22:27.630
Right.

e431445b-e418-4f53-87ce-f1142f1b7c16-0
01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:30.740
OK.

caf7a8f4-ed07-45ad-978a-ec5fc2f205b7-0
01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:34.570
We might tweak that, but.

7553adca-e51f-4e1f-b051-f29802415ac7-0
01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:39.275
I don't know if it's worthwhile
to make a distinction between

7553adca-e51f-4e1f-b051-f29802415ac7-1
01:22:39.275 --> 01:22:43.152
the dynamic data and the static
data, but again, it doesn't

7553adca-e51f-4e1f-b051-f29802415ac7-2
01:22:43.152 --> 01:22:47.158
really matter to me. I'm just
I'm curious if that's important

7553adca-e51f-4e1f-b051-f29802415ac7-3
01:22:47.158 --> 01:22:47.739
for this.

b5ad0891-a12f-429b-8bf0-f4dae1a9d443-0
01:22:51.410 --> 01:22:52.000
Umm.

aef91631-02d8-4d79-ad6a-a3e76d20397a-0
01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:02.670
In my opinion it would be in
that.

f9e9d6ba-6136-4105-8918-985d4ec4c569-0
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:08.480
The financial instrument
attributes are more static.

34ba3fa6-8387-43b1-8a8a-269d71178df6-0
01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.010
Um, you know?

db01ff40-8502-4a08-9ee8-47d9b2a7b959-0
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:15.316
d and you can't trade a
financial instrument

db01ff40-8502-4a08-9ee8-47d9b2a7b959-1
01:23:15.316 --> 01:23:15.820
inaswithout.

a2de2583-0980-46dd-bd58-32f62cfe6362-0
01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:20.316
Knowing the attributes strike,
expiration and the market data

a2de2583-0980-46dd-bd58-32f62cfe6362-1
01:23:20.316 --> 01:23:23.040
is just constantly changing,
recalculating.

4f499c3a-967a-4c8a-92ae-f90506975fc5-0
01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:24.710
Being pulled in.

1707d6de-6d2c-46ca-b480-f0c5660bebe2-0
01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:27.020
Um.

5a43e2ca-7403-4507-9701-55de2bea90c1-0
01:23:29.150 --> 01:23:31.740
Whereas once you once you define
an instrument with those

5a43e2ca-7403-4507-9701-55de2bea90c1-1
01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.080
attributes, it doesn't change.

924cc3f7-e3a4-4b9f-a3dd-eda0bc401573-0
01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.770
Yeah. OK. All right. Great.

7ce596d8-d3cc-4a1a-9761-9a80ff2b2f32-0
01:23:40.610 --> 01:23:44.530
Alright, so a a client has.

d2cdede1-d80f-406c-9270-cb5bcbea1e58-0
01:23:45.690 --> 01:23:48.520
My desks client has traders.

95075dbb-5096-4fa9-833f-47095002fe20-0
01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:50.240
A trader

17b73f72-d8f6-4fc1-9124-30c80297e4ef-0
01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:55.374
Denise, I know that I think you
grabbed desk membership from

17b73f72-d8f6-4fc1-9124-30c80297e4ef-1
01:23:55.374 --> 01:23:59.349
like the the data model, but in
general is this a A a trader

17b73f72-d8f6-4fc1-9124-30c80297e4ef-2
01:23:59.349 --> 01:24:03.063
belongs to one or more client
desks and and this doesn't

17b73f72-d8f6-4fc1-9124-30c80297e4ef-3
01:24:03.063 --> 01:24:03.519
really.

bfd82206-652c-448a-9f27-9bba81c6b6ed-0
01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:07.707
We don't need to show this. It's
really a crosswalk table, right?

bfd82206-652c-448a-9f27-9bba81c6b6ed-1
01:24:07.707 --> 01:24:10.350
It's a, it's a yeah, that's an
implementation detail, yeah.

8b5aad65-09d4-455d-b2c3-57c6aada05dc-0
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:19.320
One or more.

5afe688e-d5f3-47ad-a048-4169fd52974e-0
01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:31.300
Is the are the desk e-mail
properties.

0e79c31f-9b45-4f49-bfd9-b42b0089a57b-0
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:35.071
That's why I put that note on
there. I think it is. I think it

0e79c31f-9b45-4f49-bfd9-b42b0089a57b-1
01:24:35.071 --> 01:24:36.930
could just be a property of the
desk.

88851473-f437-4e77-bddd-2f919ded3ed2-0
01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:40.070
Yeah, I would agree.

5d15fad7-2f07-491f-9c35-a7db5d9ddee2-0
01:24:42.100 --> 01:24:43.810
Then we can get rid of it as an
entity.

8c442fe7-c78d-4c03-b8ec-ab52367b7aa4-0
01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:54.382
Mike, do we need to draw a
distinction between a client and

8c442fe7-c78d-4c03-b8ec-ab52367b7aa4-1
01:24:54.382 --> 01:24:55.740
a client's legal entities?

75fa6c08-77d4-469c-a910-e286ccb0ef61-0
01:25:02.790 --> 01:25:06.000
Umm ohh you mean like?

1f6b86b1-16b1-4076-ba34-ce51ff7e5e80-0
01:25:07.820 --> 01:25:10.080
Bungie has seven different
entities.

81237636-c184-406e-b098-fbc07892d430-0
01:25:11.470 --> 01:25:11.730
Yeah.

9dec21a4-8c7a-4669-a0ea-9b273e3af741-0
01:25:16.890 --> 01:25:17.940
No, I don't think so.

645cd17d-77ef-40e0-8664-5eff21b20a8d-0
01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.990
Just like background for you
guys.

acc146a8-8410-48d6-ba9f-c398b4e7ce19-0
01:25:22.890 --> 01:25:25.670
Like something we might talk
about casually as a client, say

acc146a8-8410-48d6-ba9f-c398b4e7ce19-1
01:25:25.670 --> 01:25:25.990
Bungie.

87f15b02-1498-4e8c-bd94-dac8bf9378ef-0
01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:30.210
They often have a number of
different operating entities.

9750928c-6a0a-4c0c-8a39-15a41159937d-0
01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:35.983
I think generally for regulatory
reasons like the most common one

9750928c-6a0a-4c0c-8a39-15a41159937d-1
01:25:35.983 --> 01:25:40.060
is to have a US operating entity
and a London operating entity.

3cd67728-5337-4568-9944-a6a780f6a4da-0
01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:44.240
So, like the traders, even might
work for.

a0ab6004-16e8-477f-adba-76d571d9a9a7-0
01:25:45.060 --> 01:25:47.792
Might be the same traders, but
they just like trades, go into

a0ab6004-16e8-477f-adba-76d571d9a9a7-1
01:25:47.792 --> 01:25:48.630
different accounts.

e2e94afb-e1a0-4f86-b263-cd4410cf05e5-0
01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:51.720
That are owned by different
legal entities.

f6f7eec5-3617-4caf-aaab-4f17393fa512-0
01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.450
And when you list them, you
would list the.

7f803fae-0f2d-448b-a837-23a65ca45009-0
01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:03.885
You you would. What we would
capture in here is the client,

7f803fae-0f2d-448b-a837-23a65ca45009-1
01:26:03.885 --> 01:26:05.060
not the overarching.

4dee0cc0-13d7-42a6-a8cc-5a79f66df6aa-0
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:07.440
Legal entity.

dfa3e391-6791-438f-bf1d-87a8dadb1990-0
01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:12.591
Yeah, I think in our current
system we don't, we don't make a

dfa3e391-6791-438f-bf1d-87a8dadb1990-1
01:26:12.591 --> 01:26:15.330
distinction between different
client entities.

52448a61-5dc8-4db0-9878-de9d34ab1c09-0
01:26:16.530 --> 01:26:17.420


9fc56038-5f31-4ad4-89ae-98ee80330ee4-0
01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:19.890
So are we all we consider?

c8e6c2c0-050c-4f42-a458-16afe0da6b44-0
01:26:21.090 --> 01:26:22.180
Any of the.

4f6ba93a-6b1f-484b-9627-56824283b5da-0
01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:28.480
We just kind of sort of look
through that layer.

8aa81825-57ec-48bf-a7b7-1ec6c92dd211-0
01:26:30.270 --> 01:26:31.800
But you do need to know the
account, right?

a5b3f1c9-64b1-41d8-8e8f-7d76cac4f32b-0
01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:34.690
Yeah, and the client could have
multiple accounts.

2c4c185e-fed7-4c00-ba38-0b4a79c7de7f-0
01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:38.610
Put that there because.

f3ea8c2a-18c9-495f-a883-afa8fb903ea5-0
01:26:39.610 --> 01:26:40.040
Oops.

fd86e003-ffe9-4b28-b3ee-1fad361a3d17-0
01:26:45.690 --> 01:26:47.520
You're way just that's right
underneath it.

ce4d1b14-f90b-4bf6-8b61-a717f7229f4c-0
01:26:49.020 --> 01:26:49.330
Oh.

02602be1-2fd1-41d4-8259-8ae81d409b05-0
01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:56.371
Maybe the client account
identifies the client, so we

02602be1-2fd1-41d4-8259-8ae81d409b05-1
01:26:56.371 --> 01:27:01.343
yeah, we could be specific about
the exact entity and you can

02602be1-2fd1-41d4-8259-8ae81d409b05-2
01:27:01.343 --> 01:27:03.830
just get that from the account.

315b6136-8716-422c-8a1b-f5079e65a89c-0
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:07.220
Yep.

688f3608-c570-4b56-ae56-09e322905f64-0
01:27:10.410 --> 01:27:11.940
Yeah, I'm going to put a little
note there.

3f1c251a-f7bf-41c3-9c09-411155c23784-0
01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:16.014
Just so we don't lose track of
that, but I don't think we need

3f1c251a-f7bf-41c3-9c09-411155c23784-1
01:27:16.014 --> 01:27:16.550
to model it.

ca92e7ca-f7b3-4355-abd2-5b09f6b7ad82-0
01:27:19.690 --> 01:27:21.580
It might be good to put clearing
firm in there.

5490ea38-f97c-4186-b2fe-ef92a6541ed6-0
01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:23.960
Alright.

ac8bac17-08b6-4de2-bd4c-a20c5a3f6088-0
01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:57.650
So clients.

0179c7b6-818f-4bc9-b0e5-82b863eb364b-0
01:28:00.850 --> 01:28:02.530
What is it clearing firm?

179aa61e-d2d0-4de8-b349-23b4856ad548-0
01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.540
A client has.

347ea0ca-9215-4c4d-8db0-8ea73a2d15f8-0
01:28:07.410 --> 01:28:10.724
One or more at least one
clearing firm and has many

347ea0ca-9215-4c4d-8db0-8ea73a2d15f8-1
01:28:10.724 --> 01:28:12.700
accounts at each clearing firm.

c5cd9601-96cc-4c57-8f23-4f473f28eecb-0
01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:20.389
And you mentioned Clearing House
as well. Is that a separate

c5cd9601-96cc-4c57-8f23-4f473f28eecb-1
01:28:20.389 --> 01:28:21.580
entity? It is, yeah.

d3225828-b920-400a-9d66-6882fb905fce-0
01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:25.637
Wait, but why not just keep that
linear? Why not just go client

d3225828-b920-400a-9d66-6882fb905fce-1
01:28:25.637 --> 01:28:27.470
account to clearing firm to
client?

6c1dd603-6d1e-445f-be0e-b7196519a142-0
01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:31.760
Ohh.

fc641842-18e3-4827-a334-1484681c23e8-0
01:28:33.630 --> 01:28:34.380
Yes, they're saying.

ca205c58-d732-4737-9ea1-81a4756bb347-0
01:28:35.300 --> 01:28:39.767
An account points to 1 clearing
firm and one clearing firm

ca205c58-d732-4737-9ea1-81a4756bb347-1
01:28:39.767 --> 01:28:43.780
points to 10 point to different
clients but but the.

d8a68212-9ef5-481b-a384-b93d9b662ae7-0
01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.060
The like unique identifier for
this is the account number.

98bb009a-82d7-4e62-a5f1-bf32185fb12f-0
01:28:50.030 --> 01:28:50.300
Yeah.

643f8094-80f3-446f-b1e5-42676e7438a2-0
01:28:52.610 --> 01:28:55.338
Well, really it's the
combination of the house number

643f8094-80f3-446f-b1e5-42676e7438a2-1
01:28:55.338 --> 01:28:56.500
and the account number.

7934be13-cd9a-468a-8e23-8a1dc51ec92d-0
01:28:59.250 --> 01:29:01.790
Sure. Fair enough. Yeah, point
taken point.

ba63a7bb-a965-40f7-9afc-52cf2aac2835-0
01:29:03.890 --> 01:29:08.165
I haven't seen two account
numbers that match and I think

ba63a7bb-a965-40f7-9afc-52cf2aac2835-1
01:29:08.165 --> 01:29:10.230
the SCM almost particularly.

01356d07-b251-4317-b866-31cfaef309ed-0
01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:13.811
Right, their account number, so
they don't overlap with one

01356d07-b251-4317-b866-31cfaef309ed-1
01:29:13.811 --> 01:29:16.382
another to prevent that sort of
thing. You're right, you're

01356d07-b251-4317-b866-31cfaef309ed-2
01:29:16.382 --> 01:29:17.240
right, you're right.

65514874-044f-4271-8ba2-5b1324f8bbbb-0
01:29:18.990 --> 01:29:21.100
Um, that is something that.

427c65fb-51fb-4ee0-89b8-c68f02a1d394-0
01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.890
Developers I've talked to
usually find confusing.

894fa5a8-d980-4cdc-ada2-a52ffe1c28b2-0
01:29:25.610 --> 01:29:26.010
Umm.

2dcb069b-ad7d-4e7f-8967-40126be596ce-0
01:29:27.050 --> 01:29:27.780
So.

1843626f-02c8-4f8e-8891-b2155bef9795-0
01:29:28.760 --> 01:29:30.390


07b1a450-ec6c-4d62-9f45-ba7721a679d9-0
01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:34.460
Basically, the clearing firm has
an account at.

ebad3214-91ca-44af-875b-c49b4bbe584a-0
01:29:36.290 --> 01:29:37.410
The clearing house.

317b8543-fa9a-4553-8e23-8534e8c6f41f-0
01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:42.190
And the House account is the
house account or the House

317b8543-fa9a-4553-8e23-8534e8c6f41f-1
01:29:42.190 --> 01:29:42.790
number is?

8d520bbb-382b-43d7-ab30-fd0b4e59a40e-0
01:29:44.370 --> 01:29:47.160
The clearing firms account
number at the clearing house.

5c0a97ee-2899-4a58-adb7-3805c162fda9-0
01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:51.470
So you mean like DTCC or
something like that?

ab704545-5927-4f41-9467-866a4293dd54-0
01:29:53.770 --> 01:29:58.805
It doesn't show up too much in
equities, which is DTCC world,

ab704545-5927-4f41-9467-866a4293dd54-1
01:29:58.805 --> 01:29:59.130
but.

a450d290-2deb-4380-bb2e-9c33daf93f9b-0
01:30:00.070 --> 01:30:01.800
Like in the futures world.

d5f1cbec-3d2e-4703-bec1-2b58d2e4f8ca-0
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:03.160


32cd2c33-47c9-49be-9d79-776380c6db62-0
01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:07.987
Like your account is usually
identified by the House account

32cd2c33-47c9-49be-9d79-776380c6db62-1
01:30:07.987 --> 01:30:11.969
and then your account. So, Mike,
I'm sure you know some of these

32cd2c33-47c9-49be-9d79-776380c6db62-2
01:30:11.969 --> 01:30:15.400
top of your head. Give me an
example. EDF is what, 365?

caa2be6d-329c-49ce-9f0c-2d52ff352a68-0
01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:19.390
Yeah, so all of the.

30e2cc8e-7c67-4ff7-8335-69ad52c7fe02-0
01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.920
All of the clients that have EDF
as they're clearing firm.

61553412-66ce-4b1e-af77-b96bb1ee40d9-0
01:30:26.050 --> 01:30:29.379
Will have a 365 House number on
their account and then an

61553412-66ce-4b1e-af77-b96bb1ee40d9-1
01:30:29.379 --> 01:30:33.053
additional account number that
specifies what account they have

61553412-66ce-4b1e-af77-b96bb1ee40d9-2
01:30:33.053 --> 01:30:34.889
which within that clearing firm.

bdc36385-91ad-470c-8535-56a402cb25fd-0
01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:39.140
It's actually not even 100%
accurate. It's.

fec4ec74-7f9b-4b43-9156-f4e9d7b62588-0
01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:45.817
Account number tying to
particular exchange EDF can have

fec4ec74-7f9b-4b43-9156-f4e9d7b62588-1
01:30:45.817 --> 01:30:50.864
multiple house numbers. The
House number it's EDS house

fec4ec74-7f9b-4b43-9156-f4e9d7b62588-2
01:30:50.864 --> 01:30:55.189
number at the CME is 365. It's
different price.

55df57a2-3661-47dc-aa8a-95e7edcffd26-0
01:30:57.050 --> 01:30:58.380
Or can be different price?

4e883a7d-4cdf-45f3-819c-39d59eac0be3-0
01:31:10.990 --> 01:31:18.980


3eab54b6-1623-4721-8ddf-f7a5d08c4519-0
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:30.580
Golly!

6b08bc56-43a1-4da2-8089-7e7c55605a5b-0
01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:38.615
We managed to do that quite a
few times today. I know why, I

6b08bc56-43a1-4da2-8089-7e7c55605a5b-1
01:31:38.615 --> 01:31:39.970
just can't not do it.

9e8c836e-71c4-42b6-a720-5a13b3f4519b-0
01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:41.190
Hmm.

f316e75a-ffcd-4cb8-9579-0e8d04f88c44-0
01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:46.010
I don't quite know, but there
were the second but.

7023d3e4-5f7e-4daf-87e0-36d767e6f4b1-0
01:31:47.610 --> 01:31:50.270
Ideas? This is also that it
connects to.

673edfe0-97f6-4fa4-8ff1-f537efa22bd2-0
01:31:52.460 --> 01:31:53.360
Exchange.

d354a989-ee80-4e1f-8391-9f8ae0df742e-0
01:31:58.300 --> 01:31:59.610
That's going to be so ugly.

8bc1b8cb-dc5a-441d-8a46-404d880265d5-0
01:32:04.020 --> 01:32:05.090
Make it pretty later.

a412b53f-a3e2-42d6-b883-c8e7479da8eb-0
01:32:09.010 --> 01:32:10.380
I think those notes are
duplicated.

262cefa2-7b6e-4fcd-b3e8-06c37ab341a2-0
01:32:15.210 --> 01:32:18.380
I was using that as a new note.

d0078c48-5338-4979-827f-e3f155af2a69-0
01:32:36.830 --> 01:32:37.840
I'll come back if I need it.

6096bb0a-f0e3-4965-bfa5-a027fb12ae31-0
01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:48.990
Can't put this in quotes because
it's kind of like lighthouse

6096bb0a-f0e3-4965-bfa5-a027fb12ae31-1
01:32:48.990 --> 01:32:49.480
keeping.

52013a06-f723-4f8b-ac3a-4d9b34f45586-0
01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:55.622
Are you a lighthouse keeping?
Are you are you keeping like a

52013a06-f723-4f8b-ac3a-4d9b34f45586-1
01:32:55.622 --> 01:32:58.240
lighthouse or are you doing just
dusting?

c16a199a-67e2-4f59-89a2-e3e5569a6d7c-0
01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:02.983
So it's not a it's not a
clearinghouse account, it's a

c16a199a-67e2-4f59-89a2-e3e5569a6d7c-1
01:33:02.983 --> 01:33:03.980
clearing House account.

54056b3c-1d28-4ed8-85f8-97e51c5c64b1-0
01:33:05.090 --> 01:33:07.760
No, it's actually the other one.
It's the first one.

9fed31ac-7f6d-4688-9f5d-c12c036b90f8-0
01:33:12.230 --> 01:33:15.243
It's a clearinghouse, like
publishers clearing, Publishers

9fed31ac-7f6d-4688-9f5d-c12c036b90f8-1
01:33:15.243 --> 01:33:16.010
Clearing House.

9a47e958-13db-4d65-a80c-8211428dddec-0
01:33:17.890 --> 01:33:21.215
Yeah, so for instance, an
example of a clearing house

9a47e958-13db-4d65-a80c-8211428dddec-1
01:33:21.215 --> 01:33:22.570
would be CME clearing.

9a638b82-b26e-4edb-95fe-1241151dfc12-0
01:33:23.250 --> 01:33:26.490
Or ice clearing US. Or ice
clearing EU.

7130e94b-bb5c-4bb3-a23a-4867c6631025-0
01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:31.503
And then the clearing firm has
an account at the clearing

7130e94b-bb5c-4bb3-a23a-4867c6631025-1
01:33:31.503 --> 01:33:31.840
house.

6ae95a09-c2ca-41ed-a5fa-e2871f85a27d-0
01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:38.231
But people usually drop the
clearing and just call it a

6ae95a09-c2ca-41ed-a5fa-e2871f85a27d-1
01:33:38.231 --> 01:33:38.520
house.

fe81fa85-283e-43cc-ab84-814b58ee9dda-0
01:33:40.450 --> 01:33:42.600
What were those ice ice bucket?

ff8779bc-de23-4a46-81bb-96ae5e71e5ba-0
01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:46.630
Ice is ice clear US or ice clear
EU?

265eed60-b676-4845-8cb3-bc692e133030-0
01:33:52.020 --> 01:34:06.940


7829ad6e-991b-4f98-99bf-59e97733ff5d-0
01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:08.880
And then I would put there that.

a9c3e5cd-fcfb-48ca-8e90-982bd73601dc-0
01:34:10.390 --> 01:34:13.850
That's often abbreviated House
account or just house.

3615af7f-84ec-4f87-8207-5a1a18dd3143-0
01:34:19.330 --> 01:34:22.720
Not, no, not there the the
clearing House account one.

52e18857-45f5-4b02-8b28-227c3f133f22-0
01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:25.000
Is abbreviated.

54fef1e6-1cc9-46fc-96d3-fd4992f2bce3-0
01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:27.770
House frequently.

19681008-7416-4494-8ae6-aa6c4554de30-0
01:34:28.930 --> 01:34:30.720
Or House number or house
account.

b2f06bc2-8af0-42c6-97f4-bd4d1c5c830d-0
01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:35.148
Yeah, it's going to run a room
in that bubble, just

b2f06bc2-8af0-42c6-97f4-bd4d1c5c830d-1
01:34:35.148 --> 01:34:36.070
logistically.

6aa8eeac-2f0f-43c2-b72c-7da5c0f8137a-0
01:34:38.150 --> 01:34:40.640
Let me let me throw this out
here as I.

238469ad-0166-4091-9a3c-6ffa8d0d4d4e-0
01:34:50.850 --> 01:34:51.560
How's account?

4c0ee38d-87ae-4360-83bd-bc1cf49e47d2-0
01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:57.374
Yeah, but it's not the
clearinghouse that's abbreviated

4c0ee38d-87ae-4360-83bd-bc1cf49e47d2-1
01:34:57.374 --> 01:35:00.099
that way. It's the clearinghouse
account. It's abbreviated that

4c0ee38d-87ae-4360-83bd-bc1cf49e47d2-2
01:35:00.099 --> 01:35:00.270
way.

703d87ec-366e-4c0b-bcaf-251b127bab89-0
01:35:08.550 --> 01:35:09.030
All right.

2f26d282-b39d-46de-b7c2-6953401a9291-0
01:35:16.450 --> 01:35:29.070


dff2c0c0-af31-43a0-b96c-4a8ceeefa166-0
01:35:29.700 --> 01:35:49.070


49b722a5-efd4-4693-adcd-260219097483-0
01:35:56.370 --> 01:35:59.050
Is it off the exchange or off
the exchange group?

7262dcfb-f4b1-4b8c-8fd6-83413e1fb548-0
01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.150
Ohh.

a57b1cf0-971c-4818-99fe-5d8194e35778-0
01:36:08.770 --> 01:36:10.120
Exchange group, right?

453ae5a4-8ce7-4f42-905c-3737644a5206-0
01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:12.500
Oh no, no, no.

ce718a99-df2f-4e2c-897c-69e3c29d5839-0
01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:16.432
No, it's exchange. Yeah, there's
kind of a many to one

ce718a99-df2f-4e2c-897c-69e3c29d5839-1
01:36:16.432 --> 01:36:18.060
relationship between all of
them.

d25f8281-1259-44e2-9645-43fcc1af4673-0
01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:21.960
Exchange. Well, an exchange will
have exactly 1 clearinghouse.

fda2a5df-3856-4ad4-a793-5fc5d302d7f6-0
01:36:22.630 --> 01:36:25.970
But an exchange group might have
more than one.

ff507bd1-cada-496a-8f29-1cac71f85daa-0
01:36:36.330 --> 01:36:39.400
Except I won't have any for OTC
but.

f48cb212-548c-4835-a256-d50dfd5256ee-0
01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:52.390
And then an exchange group might
have multiple clearinghouses.

93a4ff3b-e80c-4611-8233-6f645fb8d5ac-0
01:36:57.230 --> 01:36:58.950
Unless that's OTC, in which it
will have none.

0e6e75d7-1812-4f94-a100-cb3284916775-0
01:37:03.730 --> 01:37:07.540
Yeah, I'll go back to my little
red note here. Where?

c001a4c9-e9a7-4830-a596-ba246946c975-0
01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:15.150
That note might need to get
bigger or darker.

b4cd4283-c0ac-4311-948e-d921246c6c66-0
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:23.470
Let's go back to here. So.

2903f56e-c494-4a15-896e-ff59708abfbe-0
01:37:26.980 --> 01:37:29.460
I also want to draw a line here
that like clearing firm like.

bbfa54bd-873d-4af7-8766-a4a934a1334b-0
01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.298
Well, a client might have at
least one clearing firm. A

bbfa54bd-873d-4af7-8766-a4a934a1334b-1
01:37:34.298 --> 01:37:37.361
clearing firm could have
multiple clients, right? I

bbfa54bd-873d-4af7-8766-a4a934a1334b-2
01:37:37.361 --> 01:37:38.540
wanted to show that.

20cd8a75-8cbc-4d00-a925-2dff36c7013b-0
01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:41.410
Oops.

55f5d81a-c66b-408d-98fa-3be2cb405f57-0
01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:56.190
Not Cam as.

7d500cc7-f247-4ebd-bd6a-7b7aec6c9aca-0
01:37:59.000 --> 01:37:59.750
Has money.

8dc2ef4d-53b6-43fc-98b1-100e3c3a410a-0
01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:06.520
I don't know if it matters, but
it might only be one.

0d68b63f-0755-4478-8178-d0832c91790a-0
01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:10.134
Some operating entities have
their own, like are self

0d68b63f-0755-4478-8178-d0832c91790a-1
01:38:10.134 --> 01:38:10.550
clearing.

67abeb4b-f0d8-4f0c-82c3-bf4104d51846-0
01:38:11.620 --> 01:38:12.270
No.

6e3c29d6-34b8-4fd8-9858-9777e9e43188-0
01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:14.200
Can have Kevin.

d5bfe7bb-6da8-4b1c-a6f6-154e429420ca-0
01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:34.240


69bdc287-1d9c-445e-94f8-98899840e4b2-0
01:38:41.690 --> 01:38:42.050
Oops.

675575dc-9876-49bc-8436-9094c67927ee-0
01:38:49.290 --> 01:38:52.130
So if a client has a desk.

0ffe0876-a164-414c-860b-37487f7e0f6a-0
01:38:54.450 --> 01:38:55.880
And clients many traders.

75bfa399-bacc-41ea-9f12-6798f6aa02e5-0
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:59.860
What what bugs me a little bit
is that.

a54ffea8-2300-441b-85b2-35a569885efa-0
01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:04.190
The trade doesn't belong to the
trader.

3d7d2aa5-87cc-4a06-a999-6b2286833077-0
01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:08.890
The trade really belongs to the
desk, right?

3d19cb94-921e-4a97-b2d2-9b5cbbf2234e-0
01:39:12.690 --> 01:39:14.970
Or more specifically it it
belongs to an account.

4f1b159a-11a2-43ce-98cb-50f1895e1a30-0
01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:16.820
Which belongs to a desk.

d1f340b9-d0f3-4d25-b6ba-250f79cbfc2f-0
01:39:20.390 --> 01:39:24.380
Does an account belong to a
desk? Could you have one?

bb133da9-bcf4-448b-b01c-351c52f6504a-0
01:39:25.690 --> 01:39:28.954
One desk has multiple accounts
or one account that services

bb133da9-bcf4-448b-b01c-351c52f6504a-1
01:39:28.954 --> 01:39:29.770
multiple desks.

39b517cc-fff1-449d-9a6c-1f973578a930-0
01:39:30.550 --> 01:39:33.643
We can have one desk have
multiple accounts. We cannot

39b517cc-fff1-449d-9a6c-1f973578a930-1
01:39:33.643 --> 01:39:34.600
have one account.

6d834204-d8da-48ba-b080-f199cdc7a064-0
01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:36.630
Be used by multiple desks?

3826941c-f8f9-4a52-85be-359350f82e31-0
01:39:37.730 --> 01:39:42.051
OK, so could the should the line
go instead of from client to

3826941c-f8f9-4a52-85be-359350f82e31-1
01:39:42.051 --> 01:39:44.910
desk? Should it go from account
to desk?

a9525722-3a13-4a38-9731-2298c853e3c5-0
01:39:45.890 --> 01:39:46.340
Probably.

b35789ea-bbfb-49e8-a5a4-e5775d19119c-0
01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:56.488
Just bring it down there, Kevin,
we can make it. So I heard we

b35789ea-bbfb-49e8-a5a4-e5775d19119c-1
01:39:56.488 --> 01:39:57.560
were saying that's crazy.

7a2059ee-39f5-444e-b68b-e345f85b290f-0
01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:01.680
No, I'm no lines, lines aside.

388da14f-32db-4bd8-ad65-7bc93dd9ab33-0
01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:02.810
Hmm.

f938b217-0afb-4d63-a995-cb29e60eae78-0
01:40:04.490 --> 01:40:05.110
Umm.

b0c36e87-0b17-4e73-909c-afcea3a3e75b-0
01:40:06.820 --> 01:40:09.403
It's going to drive Kevin nuts
that the lines are ugly until we

b0c36e87-0b17-4e73-909c-afcea3a3e75b-1
01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:10.090
make them pretty.

5d8a4f16-4226-4161-b193-7b47aeb1cc84-0
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:16.950
It is ugly, but I'm also was,
was, I'm, I'm, I'm more pausing

5d8a4f16-4226-4161-b193-7b47aeb1cc84-1
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:17.660
over is.

06a962a5-5450-483e-a007-3814d3c3a325-0
01:40:22.270 --> 01:40:25.091
If I'm a client, I'm going to
create a desk and I'm going to

06a962a5-5450-483e-a007-3814d3c3a325-1
01:40:25.091 --> 01:40:26.710
associate a client account,
right?

a2ba43c6-5859-426c-a5c1-3bb6262ca2c9-0
01:40:27.750 --> 01:40:27.990
Yep.

8c31f675-37b4-4be8-a0d1-42db9ad6d1b5-0
01:40:30.560 --> 01:40:32.630
So I'd rather leave.

b83680d9-09b2-4d8c-9e25-27ad1b2fa654-0
01:40:33.630 --> 01:40:34.740
This line.

500ef189-5a4c-43a5-8ec9-eb5fb640c9e8-0
01:40:35.430 --> 01:40:36.800
And say.

0915a002-5df6-461a-9632-bad4189f0e4e-0
01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.650
An account is associated to a
desk.

a3427f59-8418-40db-998d-39eb1bf924ad-0
01:40:45.530 --> 01:40:48.440
More client desk associated to
one or more client accounts.

eeb9f55c-6750-48a1-94fa-f86075d9f40e-0
01:40:53.090 --> 01:40:56.138
God, you saying in SQL I
couldn't have the same account

eeb9f55c-6750-48a1-94fa-f86075d9f40e-1
01:40:56.138 --> 01:40:57.880
pointing to two different desks?

15741645-6d64-43ef-9440-42d303c7b72d-0
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.400
All right.

546d36d2-1b52-4e54-afc3-2a7aff241c34-0
01:41:02.580 --> 01:41:05.626
Because we got that's the,
that's how we look up where the

546d36d2-1b52-4e54-afc3-2a7aff241c34-1
01:41:05.626 --> 01:41:07.640
emails go, right? We look up the
desk.

d9e27be4-3b21-4906-b498-244a02c265f2-0
01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:09.180
Then we.

b7b380c7-9573-455e-a953-4452f89d4a38-0
01:41:09.890 --> 01:41:13.360
Send emails to the traders or to
the desk e-mail.

49f32a24-d5a0-451c-b4bc-c0cfac71b942-0
01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:20.141
So it would just return an error
if I had the same account number

49f32a24-d5a0-451c-b4bc-c0cfac71b942-1
01:41:20.141 --> 01:41:20.430
with.

d68af4ad-7df9-4cee-9c1c-a67c131c365b-0
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:22.970
Same client and different desk.

0de05ec4-0e98-453c-85f6-2a2e726196c5-0
01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:24.190
Yes.

c307842e-71b6-4caf-8f2d-95f8170d5374-0
01:41:29.370 --> 01:41:32.911
So, Kevin, the the client desk
is associated to one or more

c307842e-71b6-4caf-8f2d-95f8170d5374-1
01:41:32.911 --> 01:41:36.453
accounts, but the account can
only go to one desk, correct?

c307842e-71b6-4caf-8f2d-95f8170d5374-2
01:41:36.453 --> 01:41:39.110
Yeah, that's why I would really
more like a.

247611c7-8569-415d-aba3-49f94a6a1959-0
01:41:40.290 --> 01:41:41.400
One to many here.

a65e75dc-f55f-491f-b4d3-e64679c2bd9d-0
01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:44.850
I'll just, I'll just note it.
Whoops.

99fbe592-5852-4ea6-b73c-714a507ab3dd-0
01:41:45.860 --> 01:41:47.130
What did that?

16f54aaf-fa37-42c5-8076-7dddff74d4c4-0
01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:48.710
What just happened?

bcabc3db-39e9-4f92-b512-c962781e2746-0
01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:55.710
I can't do a return, huh?

8eb02074-3891-467e-b78a-772f81f1ab04-0
01:41:57.370 --> 01:42:15.750


9be64959-1774-47dc-99b6-cf1346d3d762-0
01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:34.350
Ohshc.

bde6d301-8b22-4c4a-a367-1fb6346e1db7-0
01:42:36.220 --> 01:42:38.987
That's probably actually not
like a real life rule, but it's

bde6d301-8b22-4c4a-a367-1fb6346e1db7-1
01:42:38.987 --> 01:42:41.710
probably an invariant that we
would maintain in our system.

e9a257c0-2c9b-4f95-bbe2-0a162aa62f90-0
01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:46.388
In which case, like our
definition of a desk might

e9a257c0-2c9b-4f95-bbe2-0a162aa62f90-1
01:42:46.388 --> 01:42:49.640
diverge from what the client
defines their own desks as.

72150387-6bd6-4634-a5e7-c03d780b8aec-0
01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:51.070
Right.

98ae46bd-532c-44f2-ac98-50eb8249b831-0
01:42:55.230 --> 01:42:58.592
But for purposes of what we're
building, do we want to allow

98ae46bd-532c-44f2-ac98-50eb8249b831-1
01:42:58.592 --> 01:43:02.174
the client account to have more
than one desk? I don't think so.

98ae46bd-532c-44f2-ac98-50eb8249b831-2
01:43:02.174 --> 01:43:02.339
OK.

a99af0b3-a53d-4380-b489-41305e3e9d5c-0
01:43:06.930 --> 01:43:08.420
My key thing that's about right.

e54a506a-def9-4420-a2e9-61fd99016aae-0
01:43:11.180 --> 01:43:14.680
I think that's right for 99.9%
of the time.

5e7f70e5-55ac-4412-b327-f8e4a381e6a7-0
01:43:15.490 --> 01:43:15.930
Yeah.

e9c8ff37-0a8a-4a35-af28-a4af981c1c3a-0
01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:20.490
Right, well, I mean, if the way
I would handle that case is I

e9c8ff37-0a8a-4a35-af28-a4af981c1c3a-1
01:43:20.490 --> 01:43:21.170
would just.

955a7098-a1c1-4da2-9c23-1c5746e05a07-0
01:43:23.670 --> 01:43:24.760


85b6c799-326b-4bb9-8bf2-d40af1c14df4-0
01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:27.790
I don't know. I guess we would
have.

ca163e50-b4fe-4540-a36e-1c9e07cf42fb-0
01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:35.440
We would sort of merge those two
desks in the.

3a421f97-ad56-4d3d-9c9c-cf7da5a7b475-0
01:43:36.510 --> 01:43:37.210
And the client.

6c792228-10d4-4841-b253-43e81f358c84-0
01:43:40.390 --> 01:43:41.020
Umm.

255f9d4b-e262-41cf-a73c-c5967e311a83-0
01:43:42.110 --> 01:43:45.943
Otherwise we would need like an
entirely different means of

255f9d4b-e262-41cf-a73c-c5967e311a83-1
01:43:45.943 --> 01:43:49.712
associating trades with client
desks like would have to be

255f9d4b-e262-41cf-a73c-c5967e311a83-2
01:43:49.712 --> 01:43:50.989
separately supplied.

0ce7deba-1b8d-45ae-93aa-ce8648f3cfb4-0
01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:52.940
Yeah.

6e8f132e-141e-453a-b9e4-4967ccb78224-0
01:43:56.090 --> 01:43:58.010
I still want to have a
connection to a trader.

454dd7ca-d3e2-4dbb-a600-070b60570b5d-0
01:43:58.860 --> 01:43:59.510
Kind of like.

8e86b399-d510-4735-8e6f-91a2b9ff1591-0
01:44:06.010 --> 01:44:07.570
I don't know book book by.

b8582fde-e853-4c39-9f1b-11ca27d87f14-0
01:44:13.250 --> 01:44:13.990
And then two.

248f3238-d127-4cc3-9e81-4dde2423dea4-0
01:44:15.530 --> 01:44:18.852
So we need to have something on
there that shows more than one

248f3238-d127-4cc3-9e81-4dde2423dea4-1
01:44:18.852 --> 01:44:22.227
because when we looked through
the stuff that Scott and Michael

248f3238-d127-4cc3-9e81-4dde2423dea4-2
01:44:22.227 --> 01:44:23.440
were showing us before.

ae5f71c2-4a19-4e67-b80b-ab945670d68b-0
01:44:25.150 --> 01:44:27.650
It was showing a buyer trader
and a seller trader.

48a41d76-8d22-4647-a0e8-99d73d088807-0
01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:36.985
Yeah, yeah. So but that's not
even that that up to two isn't

48a41d76-8d22-4647-a0e8-99d73d088807-1
01:44:36.985 --> 01:44:37.670
right.

f9fb292a-c454-4fc7-8af4-930cc473634a-0
01:44:39.060 --> 01:44:44.432
Depending on the data model that
we're using, like on CME, you

f9fb292a-c454-4fc7-8af4-930cc473634a-1
01:44:44.432 --> 01:44:45.200
can have.

773caef9-ef88-458d-a4b6-2645519fcb20-0
01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.010
As many as you want.

50253be8-410a-4d70-9c80-b27783eafb4d-0
01:44:49.310 --> 01:44:50.480
On a particular trade.

ae23cf36-8c95-4dd0-99f5-e9f88b41f179-0
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:53.150
So has many traders.

ca24279e-0156-43a8-a50a-500efc5f25d4-0
01:44:54.570 --> 01:44:55.740
Yeah, OK.

ee4968b6-6bcf-4d34-877f-c01b8b7eafff-0
01:44:56.700 --> 01:44:59.830
I just wouldn't limit it to two
is my point OK?

84065d41-2b0b-4b08-bbf9-d897218669db-0
01:45:02.570 --> 01:45:03.220
Um.

5bd6a22b-f1ae-49b7-a733-81327eab4f8f-0
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:08.030
You're envisioning like the
clear port scenario of.

503b8815-737a-466b-8059-d78471aaffe6-0
01:45:09.180 --> 01:45:11.730
We have like 3 buyers and two
sellers.

41910ccc-23d2-4c11-8e70-9640a1d75e3f-0
01:45:12.370 --> 01:45:14.680
Are going into one point.

921bc280-27f6-4a37-800c-d1d96569d4b5-0
01:45:14.940 --> 01:45:19.341
Yeah, it's the crossing where
all we're like all the market

921bc280-27f6-4a37-800c-d1d96569d4b5-1
01:45:19.341 --> 01:45:23.669
makers have the same order
number or the same trade number

921bc280-27f6-4a37-800c-d1d96569d4b5-2
01:45:23.669 --> 01:45:26.310
on their on the ticket. Yeah,
yeah.

6133c147-5493-4f86-abcc-023d79155d6b-0
01:45:28.390 --> 01:45:29.490


283a4a56-4df5-4e2f-82f4-2f84404a03e6-0
01:45:34.670 --> 01:45:36.450
Yeah, there's a concept of a
side.

9defd58a-0e15-40a5-b8a4-999f03373656-0
01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:40.150
Which maybe we should put in
there.

73020bcb-5357-43fe-beab-a9d49564528a-0
01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:45.495
You can only have two sides with
trains, but you can only have.

73020bcb-5357-43fe-beab-a9d49564528a-1
01:45:45.495 --> 01:45:48.693
Yeah, you can only have two
sides of a trade. I will go now.

73020bcb-5357-43fe-beab-a9d49564528a-2
01:45:48.693 --> 01:45:51.996
You can have up to two sides of
a trade. You can have one side

73020bcb-5357-43fe-beab-a9d49564528a-3
01:45:51.996 --> 01:45:52.940
of a trade if you.

0cdb2afd-71f2-4a0a-b5a8-40d25bf83c44-0
01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:56.390
Yeah, basically.

252c6768-ce38-4ce7-9e6c-319666995188-0
01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:00.180
I mean like a buyer or seller or
a pay or receive kind of thing.

302f5cd9-1eda-4674-a082-88f80a76aded-0
01:46:00.990 --> 01:46:04.574
Yeah, you get, I mean you have a
buyer, you can have a seller and

302f5cd9-1eda-4674-a082-88f80a76aded-1
01:46:04.574 --> 01:46:08.050
you can have then you can have
like multiple buyers or multiple

302f5cd9-1eda-4674-a082-88f80a76aded-2
01:46:08.050 --> 01:46:10.060
sellers against one buyer or
seller.

c12976c5-bd5e-49f3-aca2-029b9bd09347-0
01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:13.370
Or multiple against.

68c4c4ca-4749-4d5e-86ac-39ad2d0cd787-0
01:46:14.020 --> 01:46:15.080
On both sides, really.

6f809858-e575-40d7-bae6-53bddbc3cf27-0
01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.530
No, you can't have multiple
sides.

97835a84-6f12-4b7b-8c7c-08ff6883e830-0
01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:21.100
They were in the CME.

025c903a-04fb-4c5d-9d13-21ab894e0655-0
01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:23.700
Maybe not on a cross. I think
the blocks will do it.

4eac1a8f-2b8f-451b-94b3-6cf53b6b5948-0
01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:30.436
We tried that by CME for
somebody doing that. So I'm

4eac1a8f-2b8f-451b-94b3-6cf53b6b5948-1
01:46:30.436 --> 01:46:34.758
gonna I'm I'm fairly positive
about this that I'm the whatever

4eac1a8f-2b8f-451b-94b3-6cf53b6b5948-2
01:46:34.758 --> 01:46:38.600
the initiating side is you have
to have only one party.

d317ce1c-65e0-48d4-a88d-7e2cd634d8e3-0
01:46:44.580 --> 01:46:46.430
Let's drill into that a little
bit, so.

d9cdcf69-4c99-433d-8e9a-509c5e3e317b-0
01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:52.020
A tree is a side.

38350bc7-b713-4126-a5ca-8f62cc2a85c6-0
01:46:54.080 --> 01:46:56.920
I didn't get the whole video.
How are the legs?

b8687af1-508c-4ac3-a57f-8190498f5d84-0
01:46:58.420 --> 01:46:58.970
Different.

eff0388a-be15-44de-8199-bff47da05a38-0
01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:01.200
Then inside.

79340800-7a00-44f5-bc04-1ac796457fc6-0
01:47:02.030 --> 01:47:04.770
Yeah, so aside is by yourself.

66e45f6e-0d9f-45cc-a05f-47ec113edab8-0
01:47:05.980 --> 01:47:06.910


0d7681d4-6461-43bb-a3f7-5edbf3430043-0
01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:13.245
The so that cash lag as it
appeared in our data is actually

0d7681d4-6461-43bb-a3f7-5edbf3430043-1
01:47:13.245 --> 01:47:18.500
CACHE that's what cash was for
that. But probably we don't even

0d7681d4-6461-43bb-a3f7-5edbf3430043-2
01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:20.059
need that just leg.

d62a990e-ea75-4a69-b25f-53336295e78e-0
01:47:21.380 --> 01:47:25.438
Scott and I debated if if we
needed cash in there or not. I'm

d62a990e-ea75-4a69-b25f-53336295e78e-1
01:47:25.438 --> 01:47:29.497
like, I'm not sure why that was
there, but it's probably also

d62a990e-ea75-4a69-b25f-53336295e78e-2
01:47:29.497 --> 01:47:31.920
poorly named in the database
anyway.

65dddeb9-cb0a-4cd5-928c-f8a72530b203-0
01:47:33.230 --> 01:47:33.870
Umm.

738b951a-6080-4696-a78e-32f07a7c012b-0
01:47:35.420 --> 01:47:37.560
Yeah, so basically a trade.

93558ae3-d881-455c-905f-1be952bc2022-0
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:39.270
Umm.

2420d9e1-416c-4791-8639-34314b76199b-0
01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.390
I guess has.

81152127-8e81-4972-9380-2d6f5fa2327c-0
01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:50.230
Multiple legs. Each leg has a
quantity and an instrument.

2bbdb613-134e-4d1e-a253-a79ee650a836-0
01:48:02.830 --> 01:48:05.705
I know that I know I should be
connecting to other instrumental

2bbdb613-134e-4d1e-a253-a79ee650a836-1
01:48:05.705 --> 01:48:06.200
there, but.

3a0cb6eb-ff41-4a03-88f4-55e7fdc12826-0
01:48:13.610 --> 01:48:16.624
And I would usually think of the
quantity as just a property, not

3a0cb6eb-ff41-4a03-88f4-55e7fdc12826-1
01:48:16.624 --> 01:48:17.310
like an entity.

934a3826-efdf-4990-92e5-41abe5126263-0
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.470
Ohh.

185a7e24-b746-4b16-94be-029b3768f115-0
01:48:19.230 --> 01:48:20.500
I'm with you, OK?

5f4c3a0b-8e9a-4785-9cb8-a3bea56ee013-0
01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:34.420
Isn't the side just a property
then too?

4f7c5c32-c847-42d3-80e3-5602d9132ecf-0
01:48:37.470 --> 01:48:41.058
No, because the side groups
together multiple traders,

4f7c5c32-c847-42d3-80e3-5602d9132ecf-1
01:48:41.058 --> 01:48:41.450
right?

5010dd21-d460-43b5-ad3e-3928df57428c-0
01:48:45.570 --> 01:48:48.304
Are you going to have different
information about the buy versus

5010dd21-d460-43b5-ad3e-3928df57428c-1
01:48:48.304 --> 01:48:49.020
the sell as well?

380abaf2-1752-4b52-b9f8-dd7dbdf467f9-0
01:48:51.900 --> 01:48:52.480
What do you mean?

268cef54-7045-4add-b49c-978c108ddaac-0
01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:57.770
Will you? Will you be gathering
different information?

d5b63eb8-21d5-4117-a85f-0a3a4787b9ef-0
01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:03.348
If it's if you're talking about
the buy side versus the sell

d5b63eb8-21d5-4117-a85f-0a3a4787b9ef-1
01:49:03.348 --> 01:49:03.560
side.

45e78b3c-f384-4d65-b5c6-86da01486d12-0
01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:05.930
No, OK.

74c91813-53dc-4b57-9c70-6002f3294a08-0
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:17.882
Wait, but do we actually do
that? We don't actually group

74c91813-53dc-4b57-9c70-6002f3294a08-1
01:49:17.882 --> 01:49:21.630
this stuff by sides, we group it
by trade number, right?

d8a15eb5-1334-4e98-9e16-ce99d977bf6c-0
01:49:23.700 --> 01:49:26.120
Correct the clear port.

95b44e34-cc40-4d20-a11a-56f134169829-0
01:49:27.210 --> 01:49:27.820
System.

a63b68a7-b055-44fa-911e-34910858400c-0
01:49:30.930 --> 01:49:32.320
Has a concept of side in it.

fb2d4ecd-1c9b-4a03-8e50-d0b561317458-0
01:49:34.210 --> 01:49:36.380
Where it comes into play
basically is.

81eb5e49-74de-4e3a-9ff8-768a73a4f8a9-0
01:49:37.330 --> 01:49:37.940
Umm.

edb48d3f-5600-4e03-8358-d286ba96406b-0
01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:41.940
OK, so.

a53bb3fe-5f33-4709-b35f-4d81928b7229-0
01:49:44.190 --> 01:49:47.695
Most exchange traded trades are
one sided, essentially. Like you

a53bb3fe-5f33-4709-b35f-4d81928b7229-1
01:49:47.695 --> 01:49:50.715
don't really know who your
counterparty is on the other

a53bb3fe-5f33-4709-b35f-4d81928b7229-2
01:49:50.715 --> 01:49:51.740
side of that trade.

10d04463-efac-4d3e-84f8-8b603b31d25a-0
01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:55.644
And sort of assumed to be the
exchange or the clearinghouse of

10d04463-efac-4d3e-84f8-8b603b31d25a-1
01:49:55.644 --> 01:49:56.520
your counterparty.

e19e3d00-45f7-44fb-907a-822388055bd0-0
01:49:57.500 --> 01:50:01.241
But in some cases you actually
do know the counterparty, and

e19e3d00-45f7-44fb-907a-822388055bd0-1
01:50:01.241 --> 01:50:04.370
that's the case with a cross
trader a block trade.

7a837722-f81f-4754-9b63-a83d64309f7d-0
01:50:05.850 --> 01:50:08.104
Or at least we know the
counterparty. Our actual clients

7a837722-f81f-4754-9b63-a83d64309f7d-1
01:50:08.104 --> 01:50:08.500
might not.

c98784c7-7c9c-4e77-9777-81d45d633521-0
01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:10.730
And so.

296feb44-d293-4313-9393-b9ef99e0338a-0
01:50:13.660 --> 01:50:16.715
In that case like the the
quantity means different things

296feb44-d293-4313-9393-b9ef99e0338a-1
01:50:16.715 --> 01:50:20.034
to the different sides, like the
buy side essentially is doing

296feb44-d293-4313-9393-b9ef99e0338a-2
01:50:20.034 --> 01:50:23.459
the trade with the quantities as
listed in the legs and the sell

296feb44-d293-4313-9393-b9ef99e0338a-3
01:50:23.459 --> 01:50:25.830
side is doing the trade with the
quantities.

912d879a-c95b-4140-88b6-dacf5acd51f0-0
01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:29.910
With the opposite sign in the
legs.

094d4ee4-1971-42f7-ad42-0bb78ca14c97-0
01:50:33.070 --> 01:50:35.480
That's sort of why you need the
side as it groups together.

b3e1e84e-eb76-4299-9856-abfe0a2b64c8-0
01:50:36.910 --> 01:50:37.520
Um.

b1e1d617-bf2c-439e-85dc-be98feebad14-0
01:50:38.890 --> 01:50:41.270
Like, what's what trade are you
actually doing?

610cec74-3ffe-4c4b-a7df-4e6a6dfd39c6-0
01:50:45.190 --> 01:50:46.840
And price be different for each
flag.

6438bcf1-11da-446c-bac0-911ee015a328-0
01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:51.632
Price can either be specified at
the leg level or at the trade

6438bcf1-11da-446c-bac0-911ee015a328-1
01:50:51.632 --> 01:50:51.950
level.

a3568b19-3eb4-4746-a92c-31161b55456e-0
01:50:53.970 --> 01:50:54.480
Cool.

56550d5c-2c93-463d-b2da-64c774c1f89b-0
01:51:06.020 --> 01:51:07.980
It should be defined at both
levels, right?

98694934-3122-43e5-be6d-f3cce9f3fcbc-0
01:51:09.780 --> 01:51:14.209
Well, if you have leg prices,
you can compute a trade price.

98694934-3122-43e5-be6d-f3cce9f3fcbc-1
01:51:14.209 --> 01:51:18.494
If you have a trade price, you
cannot compute a unique leg

98694934-3122-43e5-be6d-f3cce9f3fcbc-2
01:51:18.494 --> 01:51:18.930
price.

7832622e-5ecf-45f0-98c2-5f6f40809b1b-0
01:51:21.420 --> 01:51:23.120
Uh, yeah, yeah, I agree.

388c4745-9149-46c0-bb57-6e62a17c0211-0
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:28.540
Oh, I OK, fine.

035ed70f-02c2-4589-b062-c2cdf7fccb68-0
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:34.800
It's more convenient if they
give you a leg price.

7d00b2e4-f609-463a-bc24-2d5c585bf887-0
01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:36.590


0d881709-0aee-4b8d-a9f6-d858cc99776f-0
01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:38.220
But.

4bd7560f-d591-4903-8544-ffa9f33aa448-0
01:51:40.570 --> 01:51:44.401
Sometimes you just don't have
one. That's not how our system

4bd7560f-d591-4903-8544-ffa9f33aa448-1
01:51:44.401 --> 01:51:45.720
works though, on the.

a34cd85d-632d-4fdc-bf7d-4cb06f7c761f-0
01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:49.180
Like ethanol stuff?

e9b4f197-9a9b-4d4f-b15d-25e3730dee4e-0
01:51:52.850 --> 01:51:56.517
It is actually. You can put a a
leg price or a trade price, but

e9b4f197-9a9b-4d4f-b15d-25e3730dee4e-1
01:51:56.517 --> 01:52:00.126
it's not required to put the leg
price in. I guess my point is

e9b4f197-9a9b-4d4f-b15d-25e3730dee4e-2
01:52:00.126 --> 01:52:01.329
it's not computed at.

37d51a42-8510-448c-8bfe-c1cdaa65da28-0
01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:03.160
The.

d978cd1f-60ee-42f6-a2cf-accb04f2fb58-0
01:52:05.070 --> 01:52:05.920
Trade level.

c1ea0b1b-1657-44e7-bd18-665384e244b2-0
01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:09.610
It's a required.

90930d13-7d87-4d2d-ac3d-d013e415ecf3-0
01:52:12.850 --> 01:52:16.150
At the it's required for the
user input at the trade level.

cf5e51f9-835f-4c6d-86fb-7073ef1af7b6-0
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:18.390
I don't think that's true.

cfdc2d6b-ff8b-41c7-ba9a-57566b996d25-0
01:52:21.390 --> 01:52:25.196
For the ethanol recap, I think
you can either have trade a

cfdc2d6b-ff8b-41c7-ba9a-57566b996d25-1
01:52:25.196 --> 01:52:28.810
trade price, trade prices, leg
prices are both I think.

ed66c46c-a12c-4356-915a-d6d62e4686a9-0
01:52:31.950 --> 01:52:32.360
OK.

1ddefa1a-ff80-4b24-87c9-143dc5fc9add-0
01:52:35.070 --> 01:52:36.200
That's how I meant to program
it.

93f8daba-f4aa-4e9b-bea4-8e980449ec13-0
01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:37.970
It might not actually do that.

ec926c51-212e-4105-ae03-451d2802f0dc-0
01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:44.210
I'm just a silly end user. I
don't know anything.

30c4133e-192e-486c-9ca4-309014db13c5-0
01:52:46.210 --> 01:52:48.335
I'm just a silly developer. I
don't know what the software

30c4133e-192e-486c-9ca4-309014db13c5-1
01:52:48.335 --> 01:52:48.840
actually does.

463daf5d-36b6-4fca-b7d2-0d33833825fc-0
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:53.000
I don't know what I asked for. I
don't know what it does.

e8ae9cf7-d965-4b2d-a6cf-bf6c20152510-0
01:52:55.230 --> 01:52:55.810
So.

5f8468ae-2e3a-489c-8da2-839571340ed1-0
01:52:57.140 --> 01:52:59.320
Kevin, we've got about 3 minutes
left, yeah.

5e79f596-1f95-4bfb-ab8e-1bb72cc56bcb-0
01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:04.004
You might need to clean this up
and and maybe have a a follow up

5e79f596-1f95-4bfb-ab8e-1bb72cc56bcb-1
01:53:04.004 --> 01:53:07.035
a little bit later. Yeah, we
have another session scheduled

5e79f596-1f95-4bfb-ab8e-1bb72cc56bcb-2
01:53:07.035 --> 01:53:10.218
for I think it's Monday that we
can actually continue this and

5e79f596-1f95-4bfb-ab8e-1bb72cc56bcb-3
01:53:10.218 --> 01:53:13.199
then get some more time on the
calendar next week. I think

5e79f596-1f95-4bfb-ab8e-1bb72cc56bcb-4
01:53:13.199 --> 01:53:15.119
we've made some good progress
though.

7d10a0cf-8ddc-44e6-a75d-98ac91d217eb-0
01:53:16.730 --> 01:53:22.080
So does it when when we book a
trade does that?

3e1691e5-4f57-4568-89c4-8a064f50bf09-0
01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:26.212
Trade actually go into an
account or is it trade that

3e1691e5-4f57-4568-89c4-8a064f50bf09-1
01:53:26.212 --> 01:53:28.260
booked an account or is it
trade?

24889972-622c-4d2b-9da7-64ec9951818b-0
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:31.650
It's a little leg booked into
the client account.

41664dbf-95b8-4eb9-84a4-c11515dc1ec2-0
01:53:34.860 --> 01:53:37.554
I think usually it gets broken
out into legs. It's

41664dbf-95b8-4eb9-84a4-c11515dc1ec2-1
01:53:37.554 --> 01:53:40.830
theoretically possible for you
to be booked as a whole trade.

9d635e5b-a06b-4e16-bf8e-b5c6bb130a8b-0
01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:43.260
Actually.

5a71b21d-0fee-43be-a17d-337872381191-0
01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:46.850
I don't know so like the the STP
API.

516cc32b-fa2b-4e64-9732-eca10dc68335-0
01:53:48.410 --> 01:53:50.430
Gives you it as a as a basket.

9ade712b-0dc6-4166-bc6f-afaa9a3371c8-0
01:53:53.070 --> 01:53:57.530
Then I guess all of like the
clearing firm outputs I've seen

9ade712b-0dc6-4166-bc6f-afaa9a3371c8-1
01:53:57.530 --> 01:53:58.920
are all broken out.

09d23e1f-d3b1-400f-9e93-12ea1773bd64-0
01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:01.990


c91cd6de-0da4-4243-9a20-217e7e6649c9-0
01:54:04.470 --> 01:54:06.880
And like the the Teo files
broken out.

81c3d9d4-37ab-4bb9-9b9b-37e52e5c7228-0
01:54:12.610 --> 01:54:17.126
I feel like I want to introduce
like the term of like position

81c3d9d4-37ab-4bb9-9b9b-37e52e5c7228-1
01:54:17.126 --> 01:54:17.700
in this.

7dcc567e-eb66-4863-8b4a-b71bcb9c0e81-0
01:54:18.710 --> 01:54:22.670
As as something separate than a
trade.

334955d8-ab6b-405b-be6c-74664fd979d3-0
01:54:24.860 --> 01:54:28.872
I don't know if that's necessary
or not, but I feel like I'm

334955d8-ab6b-405b-be6c-74664fd979d3-1
01:54:28.872 --> 01:54:32.950
going to work position a lot and
I position and margin, we're

334955d8-ab6b-405b-be6c-74664fd979d3-2
01:54:32.950 --> 01:54:37.160
both hanging up there waiting to
get introduced. Oh, great. OK.

42a00395-b88a-49fa-9680-4832c5813cb1-0
01:54:38.690 --> 01:54:39.980
I was reading your mind,
Michael.

924a2131-b610-46b0-a8e1-40f952a285fc-0
01:54:41.400 --> 01:54:42.260
Umm.

4593b48f-0898-439d-be4c-ad8d8da06d0a-0
01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:46.399
Well, let me tell you what.
Let's let's put this as as as

4593b48f-0898-439d-be4c-ad8d8da06d0a-1
01:54:46.399 --> 01:54:47.600
red switch to come back to.

549ab1e2-0624-4aa8-b208-50eff724e948-0
01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:52.320
Um and margin.

772c88c4-38f7-4f65-9075-c04e37efdb8b-0
01:54:53.770 --> 01:54:54.630
Like TBD.

951af0f1-e3cd-43ce-a44b-0203160e3d3d-0
01:54:56.090 --> 01:55:01.775
And let's just finish up leg and
then call it a day should should

951af0f1-e3cd-43ce-a44b-0203160e3d3d-1
01:55:01.775 --> 01:55:02.120
leg.

31927692-8e5c-47bc-a63e-974ff8752956-0
01:55:02.810 --> 01:55:05.187
Do you book a leg into an
account or do you book a trade

31927692-8e5c-47bc-a63e-974ff8752956-1
01:55:05.187 --> 01:55:05.730
into account?

3ba7793b-4894-49fc-bfc9-74198f5b2933-0
01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:09.057
Sounds like you took a leg into
account. It could really be

3ba7793b-4894-49fc-bfc9-74198f5b2933-1
01:55:09.057 --> 01:55:09.360
either.

6400e73a-c21f-421b-bad0-9b8e0273d7e2-0
01:55:12.410 --> 01:55:14.760
Well, it's a if a trade only had
one leg.

7ef781c2-767d-41f8-b080-a1d4d3d5843a-0
01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:17.760
Are you really effectively
booking the leg?

97cc8c95-628a-4c90-808f-ac447d42d855-0
01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:23.208
But you could get the whole
trade with all of its legs

97cc8c95-628a-4c90-808f-ac447d42d855-1
01:55:23.208 --> 01:55:25.835
together, right? Yeah. I mean,
it's kind of a philosophical

97cc8c95-628a-4c90-808f-ac447d42d855-2
01:55:25.835 --> 01:55:26.230
question.

8658b4a7-0189-4931-bb01-a3f4f626a28b-0
01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:31.240
Chicken or egg your leg? Yeah.
So like.

437bf4b3-b5a2-40f2-b6ac-c585ce63dbb2-0
01:55:32.310 --> 01:55:35.688
At least like I personally like
prefer if the trade is grouped

437bf4b3-b5a2-40f2-b6ac-c585ce63dbb2-1
01:55:35.688 --> 01:55:37.780
in a a trade was booked to an
account.

041a4786-9a81-418a-b9bd-c4b115b11adf-0
01:55:39.300 --> 01:55:42.696
But some data sources don't do
it that way, no. In fact, the

041a4786-9a81-418a-b9bd-c4b115b11adf-1
01:55:42.696 --> 01:55:46.036
one the primary one we use,
doesn't do it that way. We have

041a4786-9a81-418a-b9bd-c4b115b11adf-2
01:55:46.036 --> 01:55:47.150
to do it leg by leg.

dfc09879-f603-4002-ab94-1417f00823f5-0
01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:52.730
Teo does that, but STP does Teo
groups and or Tao groups and by.

19f4db6e-4dc5-4a5a-ae00-cd1da8a315d1-0
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:57.590
Sorry, SP groups by trades. Yep.
And Teo does it by likes, yeah.

66375d40-9616-4eca-a6a2-cc32336b7d6b-0
01:56:05.780 --> 01:56:07.370
But we actually reconstruct.

af33230d-eb83-45e1-b088-1b7a1b291d0b-0
01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:11.960
The tail legs back into a trade.

a1eb7016-f253-4e3a-abed-6be849a51349-0
01:56:15.130 --> 01:56:17.960
OK, I curses, but I get it.

083439b5-69f6-4abd-aacd-27b328236234-0
01:56:19.950 --> 01:56:24.640
Let me put this here and I'll
put it as a.

e48f81bf-7023-48ad-ad76-5f7f30d5ca13-0
01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:27.210
Call out that we should talk
about that again.

f439fa94-97fd-494b-a942-846a84d1d12e-0
01:56:30.390 --> 01:56:30.620
Right.

d1535c02-a004-425b-82b8-7b0147c0e26e-0
01:56:33.170 --> 01:56:33.500
So.

9ae387cd-3567-439e-b35c-ef1a687b7ecb-0
01:56:52.860 --> 01:56:56.935
Booing just because you don't
like it Friday and stuff there,

9ae387cd-3567-439e-b35c-ef1a687b7ecb-1
01:56:56.935 --> 01:56:57.330
Kevin.

c4c8a17e-3c30-48a1-97d0-adc40d46e92d-0
01:56:59.370 --> 01:57:01.480
That's all right.

bb63ed78-b5ca-4cfb-b238-88974ddae505-0
01:57:02.930 --> 01:57:03.410
All right.

8208ba38-6e40-4a10-b8f7-caf3f7c09a35-0
01:57:05.110 --> 01:57:06.820
All right, let's clean this up
and we'll.

237fd508-4cf8-4561-aa80-bc12fe68572a-0
01:57:08.630 --> 01:57:09.520
Send it back out.

84531b9e-aeef-4e6f-b257-e69e1efb301e-0
01:57:11.650 --> 01:57:13.490
What I'm going to do, and I
actually.

c239d7a3-9c77-4175-a0dc-419d3dedfc89-0
01:57:14.840 --> 01:57:18.277
Made an attempt to share this so
it can't, so I can just share

c239d7a3-9c77-4175-a0dc-419d3dedfc89-1
01:57:18.277 --> 01:57:21.823
the URL and Scott, Michael, you
can see it as well. So I'm going

c239d7a3-9c77-4175-a0dc-419d3dedfc89-2
01:57:21.823 --> 01:57:25.096
to send that out when we get
done. So hopefully you will be

c239d7a3-9c77-4175-a0dc-419d3dedfc89-3
01:57:25.096 --> 01:57:27.769
able to get into this and see
what we're seeing.

01:57:29.170 --> 01:57:32.987
If it doesn't work, let me know.
We can, you know, come up with

ed97afb6-def4-4134-b047-c6499b2a0438-1
01:57:32.987 --> 01:57:36.864
someone some other way to do it,
but hopefully you'll be able to

ed97afb6-def4-4134-b047-c6499b2a0438-2
01:57:36.864 --> 01:57:40.502
see it right along with us and
as we're cleaning up, see the

ed97afb6-def4-4134-b047-c6499b2a0438-3
01:57:40.502 --> 01:57:40.979
changes.

01:57:41.650 --> 01:57:42.000
Great.

01:57:46.010 --> 01:57:49.195
All right. I think we're good. I
think we are good and we will

2c0f6e8e-dcd6-49ee-bb92-631804facbd5-1
01:57:49.195 --> 01:57:52.178
continue on Monday. I know we
didn't get too, you know, we

2c0f6e8e-dcd6-49ee-bb92-631804facbd5-2
01:57:52.178 --> 01:57:55.415
talked more about what you have
now and we'll extend that as we

2c0f6e8e-dcd6-49ee-bb92-631804facbd5-3
01:57:55.415 --> 01:57:58.550
get into what you're looking at
to go forward. But I think we

2c0f6e8e-dcd6-49ee-bb92-631804facbd5-4
01:57:58.550 --> 01:58:00.320
made a lot of good progress
today.
