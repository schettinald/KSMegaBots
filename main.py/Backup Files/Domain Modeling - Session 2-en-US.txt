2cf7f3ca-f9ce-47a2-8e7f-d1d035acf596-0
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.543
On it. And then you're
presenting that to the front

2cf7f3ca-f9ce-47a2-8e7f-d1d035acf596-1
00:00:04.543 --> 00:00:09.742
end. Yep, correct. OK physical
confirm is, is that the entering

2cf7f3ca-f9ce-47a2-8e7f-d1d035acf596-2
00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:14.615
the ethanol trades? That's
ethanol trades, Yep. OK. And did

2cf7f3ca-f9ce-47a2-8e7f-d1d035acf596-3
00:00:14.615 --> 00:00:19.002
you want to expand it out to
different product types,

2cf7f3ca-f9ce-47a2-8e7f-d1d035acf596-4
00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:24.200
different underlyings? Yes, that
was the goal was at some point

2cf7f3ca-f9ce-47a2-8e7f-d1d035acf596-5
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.800
to expand it out to any sort of.

98ecce16-7fd1-496d-8729-8571d30bf1ed-0
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:38.317
I want to make sure I'm using
the correct terminology, but

98ecce16-7fd1-496d-8729-8571d30bf1ed-1
00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:47.242
different products is what we're
looking to expand that to. All

98ecce16-7fd1-496d-8729-8571d30bf1ed-2
00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:55.610
right. OTC pricer. Yeah. So that
is is it's basically like.

52eae7df-4f25-4eb1-9671-483cab59511d-0
00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.351
V2 of the physical confirm, it's
just there's a lot more going

52eae7df-4f25-4eb1-9671-483cab59511d-1
00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:06.481
into it. There's sorry, so
there's a there's a confirm

52eae7df-4f25-4eb1-9671-483cab59511d-2
00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:11.362
piece, which is really important
to how OTC's are traded that we

52eae7df-4f25-4eb1-9671-483cab59511d-3
00:01:11.362 --> 00:01:15.417
would need to build. And then
there's also a database

52eae7df-4f25-4eb1-9671-483cab59511d-4
00:01:15.417 --> 00:01:19.998
component to storing all of the
parameters for an OTC trade,

52eae7df-4f25-4eb1-9671-483cab59511d-5
00:01:19.998 --> 00:01:24.804
which is much more complicated
than anything we've got anywhere

52eae7df-4f25-4eb1-9671-483cab59511d-6
00:01:24.804 --> 00:01:25.179
else.

00e73212-efc0-4f47-9272-6522b0a9774b-0
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.916
And then this API piece was a
third component which would, we

00e73212-efc0-4f47-9272-6522b0a9774b-1
00:01:31.916 --> 00:01:37.177
would input a bunch of the
parameters for the OTC trade and

00e73212-efc0-4f47-9272-6522b0a9774b-2
00:01:37.177 --> 00:01:42.702
the, you know, use the API to
connect to our third party who's

00e73212-efc0-4f47-9272-6522b0a9774b-3
00:01:42.702 --> 00:01:48.314
providing pricing and they would
spit back a price based on the

00e73212-efc0-4f47-9272-6522b0a9774b-4
00:01:48.314 --> 00:01:51.120
parameters that we were sending.

cded9825-cddd-4319-97c2-b8b0a71159b0-0
00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.202
All right. This is a white
labeling. Yeah. Do you have that

cded9825-cddd-4319-97c2-b8b0a71159b0-1
00:02:02.202 --> 00:02:09.830
contract set up with that major
bank? No, okay, we have been

cded9825-cddd-4319-97c2-b8b0a71159b0-2
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.833
pushing it for 10 months now.
And as any former Bank of

cded9825-cddd-4319-97c2-b8b0a71159b0-3
00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:21.460
America people might know, the
bank.

ec648e3e-c3ef-4c94-bae8-dae6fd43749a-0
00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.790
Processing is just real slow.
Yep. No. Understood. These are

ec648e3e-c3ef-4c94-bae8-dae6fd43749a-1
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.941
our clients, so we get it. But
the reason I was asking was just

ec648e3e-c3ef-4c94-bae8-dae6fd43749a-2
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:39.093
a gauge priority, right? Like if
it's signed, I bet this would.

ec648e3e-c3ef-4c94-bae8-dae6fd43749a-3
00:02:39.093 --> 00:02:44.084
Yeah, yeah, right, right. No,
it's a low priority item as far

ec648e3e-c3ef-4c94-bae8-dae6fd43749a-4
00:02:44.084 --> 00:02:48.592
as the fully integrated solution
with that API keys and

ec648e3e-c3ef-4c94-bae8-dae6fd43749a-5
00:02:48.592 --> 00:02:49.880
everything else.

6cb9dd19-5f80-433c-83d3-d6dbea38c85c-0
00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.646
The confirm and database, we do
have clients who are papered and

6cb9dd19-5f80-433c-83d3-d6dbea38c85c-1
00:02:56.646 --> 00:03:01.642
ready to go. So like that would
be an item that we're interested

6cb9dd19-5f80-433c-83d3-d6dbea38c85c-2
00:03:01.642 --> 00:03:06.100
in, but it's not high priority
for us because there's not

6cb9dd19-5f80-433c-83d3-d6dbea38c85c-3
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.481
enough scale yet where it makes
sense to devote a lot of

6cb9dd19-5f80-433c-83d3-d6dbea38c85c-4
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:15.170
resources to it. All right?
These are client facing xfinder,

6cb9dd19-5f80-433c-83d3-d6dbea38c85c-5
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.169
so that is a.

0370bbba-7dae-4c62-bae1-1445b0a851fb-0
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.929
Iteration over the ball
dashboard. So it basically it's

0370bbba-7dae-4c62-bae1-1445b0a851fb-1
00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:28.849
more of a front end piece to
make the ball dashboard more

0370bbba-7dae-4c62-bae1-1445b0a851fb-2
00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:34.278
interactive. So I'm not sure how
much you guys have played with

0370bbba-7dae-4c62-bae1-1445b0a851fb-3
00:03:34.278 --> 00:03:39.706
the ball dashboard, but there's
a bunch of rows listed for each

0370bbba-7dae-4c62-bae1-1445b0a851fb-4
00:03:39.706 --> 00:03:44.626
expiration for a product and
basically if a customer or a

0370bbba-7dae-4c62-bae1-1445b0a851fb-5
00:03:44.626 --> 00:03:45.219
broker.

1bd2244e-3224-4dba-b653-8a130dd8f359-0
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.311
Had an interest in a particular
expiration, they could click on

1bd2244e-3224-4dba-b653-8a130dd8f359-1
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:56.075
a number of buttons that would
price up various trades that

1bd2244e-3224-4dba-b653-8a130dd8f359-2
00:03:56.075 --> 00:04:00.283
would be stored in like a
dashboard type area or hot

1bd2244e-3224-4dba-b653-8a130dd8f359-3
00:04:00.283 --> 00:04:05.285
trades, what we like to call it
and they would be able to view

1bd2244e-3224-4dba-b653-8a130dd8f359-4
00:04:05.285 --> 00:04:10.128
those trades and then interact
with that with that hot trade

1bd2244e-3224-4dba-b653-8a130dd8f359-5
00:04:10.128 --> 00:04:12.590
and potentially execute trades.

6acda8aa-f6e8-47fa-b7f7-d3bc716777d2-0
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.094
It sounds a little bit like
you're viewing your favorite

6acda8aa-f6e8-47fa-b7f7-d3bc716777d2-1
00:04:25.094 --> 00:04:32.003
types and then be able to hit
execute if needed. Yep. Okay,

6acda8aa-f6e8-47fa-b7f7-d3bc716777d2-2
00:04:32.003 --> 00:04:38.797
margin optimizer. That would be.
So that one's a tougher 1

6acda8aa-f6e8-47fa-b7f7-d3bc716777d2-3
00:04:38.797 --> 00:04:45.822
because we don't know. There's a
lot of things we don't know

6acda8aa-f6e8-47fa-b7f7-d3bc716777d2-4
00:04:45.822 --> 00:04:47.550
there and that.

a03e3ca4-5a64-4569-aa8a-80c13c79bd68-0
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.539
Makes it difficult to build, but
basically a client there's there

a03e3ca4-5a64-4569-aa8a-80c13c79bd68-1
00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:00.270
are some standardized position
outputs that'll just you know

a03e3ca4-5a64-4569-aa8a-80c13c79bd68-2
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.342
contract strike expiration,
price, quantity etcetera,

a03e3ca4-5a64-4569-aa8a-80c13c79bd68-3
00:05:05.342 --> 00:05:11.072
etcetera, etcetera and then
client would upload that file to

a03e3ca4-5a64-4569-aa8a-80c13c79bd68-4
00:05:11.072 --> 00:05:15.299
through our front end and it
would spit out.

b1d072da-0150-4078-8802-de061ca64256-0
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.236
What their current margin is
according to span. And so the

b1d072da-0150-4078-8802-de061ca64256-1
00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:25.122
CME and I both publish. If you
submit a position file, they'll

b1d072da-0150-4078-8802-de061ca64256-2
00:05:25.122 --> 00:05:29.698
tell you what your margin is.
And then we have a tool that

b1d072da-0150-4078-8802-de061ca64256-3
00:05:29.698 --> 00:05:34.584
goes on top of that, that just
needs to be iterated that says,

b1d072da-0150-4078-8802-de061ca64256-4
00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:39.238
oh hey, these are the So what
the margin calculation engine

b1d072da-0150-4078-8802-de061ca64256-5
00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:41.100
does, it just tells you.

efa738f6-3092-42a5-b17b-a890cc498df7-0
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.858
It runs it through like 18
different scenarios and says

efa738f6-3092-42a5-b17b-a890cc498df7-1
00:05:45.858 --> 00:05:49.506
which scenario generates the
highest margin number. And then

efa738f6-3092-42a5-b17b-a890cc498df7-2
00:05:49.506 --> 00:05:53.034
our optimizer, we're going and
say, oh, to get that number

efa738f6-3092-42a5-b17b-a890cc498df7-3
00:05:53.034 --> 00:05:56.860
down. This is the trade that you
would do to do that. There's a

efa738f6-3092-42a5-b17b-a890cc498df7-4
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.508
lot of product knowledge and to
that, but I guess we're just

efa738f6-3092-42a5-b17b-a890cc498df7-5
00:06:00.508 --> 00:06:03.617
looking for the help on the
technical components of

efa738f6-3092-42a5-b17b-a890cc498df7-6
00:06:03.617 --> 00:06:07.205
uploading a file, running it
through the optimizer and then

efa738f6-3092-42a5-b17b-a890cc498df7-7
00:06:07.205 --> 00:06:10.793
spitting out something on the
front end that looks coherent

efa738f6-3092-42a5-b17b-a890cc498df7-8
00:06:10.793 --> 00:06:11.750
and makes sense.

ba1e7d46-13e1-4191-adde-0920ee5ef312-0
00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:18.321
What sort of a margin
calculations do the exchanges

ba1e7d46-13e1-4191-adde-0920ee5ef312-1
00:06:18.321 --> 00:06:22.880
use? They have a span file, it
stresses every position they

ba1e7d46-13e1-4191-adde-0920ee5ef312-2
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.591
they it's this huge file and it
takes every single instrument

ba1e7d46-13e1-4191-adde-0920ee5ef312-3
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:31.695
and you know stresses that
single instrument and then

ba1e7d46-13e1-4191-adde-0920ee5ef312-4
00:06:31.695 --> 00:06:36.330
multiplies just your position
with that number and then sums

ba1e7d46-13e1-4191-adde-0920ee5ef312-5
00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.850
it all up basically.

da60f9f6-0996-457f-a728-af63d0e5da26-0
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:50.366
So does he use things like a
like a SIM model that, you know,

da60f9f6-0996-457f-a728-af63d0e5da26-1
00:06:50.366 --> 00:06:57.033
Scott would know this a lot
better than I would to be honest

da60f9f6-0996-457f-a728-af63d0e5da26-2
00:06:57.033 --> 00:07:03.700
with you, OK. And a different
client, we're working on a SIM

da60f9f6-0996-457f-a728-af63d0e5da26-3
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.510
standard initial margin model
which, which.

87ec45e5-8cbb-4065-9347-aea3b34ce2a1-0
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:17.059
It calls the same sort of logic
like conceptual logic of what is

87ec45e5-8cbb-4065-9347-aea3b34ce2a1-1
00:07:17.059 --> 00:07:22.272
your initial margin and it has
you know, whole bunch of

87ec45e5-8cbb-4065-9347-aea3b34ce2a1-2
00:07:22.272 --> 00:07:27.949
correlations across positions,
correlations across commodity

87ec45e5-8cbb-4065-9347-aea3b34ce2a1-3
00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:32.510
risk, foreign exchange risk,
etcetera. And to my

87ec45e5-8cbb-4065-9347-aea3b34ce2a1-4
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:38.280
understanding it's an industry
standard, but I've not used it

87ec45e5-8cbb-4065-9347-aea3b34ce2a1-5
00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.770
in the past, so.

10c1d208-02f5-4e6e-831a-8e14467cbd20-0
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:45.293
It's still moving, but it sounds
very similar. Yeah, Scott's our

10c1d208-02f5-4e6e-831a-8e14467cbd20-1
00:07:45.293 --> 00:07:49.966
span expert. He spent a lot of
time working on that. He can

10c1d208-02f5-4e6e-831a-8e14467cbd20-2
00:07:49.966 --> 00:07:54.952
tell you everything you want to
know. OK. Can you guys hear me?

10c1d208-02f5-4e6e-831a-8e14467cbd20-3
00:07:54.952 --> 00:07:59.703
Oh, yes. OK. My computer is
pretty seriously misbehaving. It

10c1d208-02f5-4e6e-831a-8e14467cbd20-4
00:07:59.703 --> 00:08:04.377
took, like 12 minutes for zoom
to open, so I don't know how

10c1d208-02f5-4e6e-831a-8e14467cbd20-5
00:08:04.377 --> 00:08:06.870
well this is going to go for me.

5baf9ea8-3b84-489c-b65e-af75b13ae53b-0
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.892
But I'm here, so you're in a
good mood in a Monday morning

5baf9ea8-3b84-489c-b65e-af75b13ae53b-1
00:08:15.892 --> 00:08:21.945
then. Yeah, real good. All
right. We're just going through

5baf9ea8-3b84-489c-b65e-af75b13ae53b-2
00:08:21.945 --> 00:08:27.588
the, the eight products here
that I'm sharing our risk

5baf9ea8-3b84-489c-b65e-af75b13ae53b-3
00:08:27.588 --> 00:08:32.000
manager. So some of our
customers have us.

0bb6a052-7bd0-40d3-8952-3d2bf991fdee-0
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:39.888
Track or like so some of our
customers execute solely through

0bb6a052-7bd0-40d3-8952-3d2bf991fdee-1
00:08:39.888 --> 00:08:43.987
us and then they expect us to
submit to them a like basically

0bb6a052-7bd0-40d3-8952-3d2bf991fdee-2
00:08:43.987 --> 00:08:48.350
a blotter of all their trade. So
they can manage their their own,

0bb6a052-7bd0-40d3-8952-3d2bf991fdee-3
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:52.448
they uploaded it into a their
own file and it just tells what

0bb6a052-7bd0-40d3-8952-3d2bf991fdee-4
00:08:52.448 --> 00:08:56.613
their delta is and everything
like that. What we want to do is

0bb6a052-7bd0-40d3-8952-3d2bf991fdee-5
00:08:56.613 --> 00:09:00.645
like cut out that piece and say
we'll execute everything for

0bb6a052-7bd0-40d3-8952-3d2bf991fdee-6
00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:00.910
you.

bd30750e-8eac-4b38-8a9b-3ba15ccaa099-0
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.977
And we'll give you that risk
piece. You don't have to do

bd30750e-8eac-4b38-8a9b-3ba15ccaa099-1
00:09:04.977 --> 00:09:09.000
anything besides, you know, log
into our front end and take a

bd30750e-8eac-4b38-8a9b-3ba15ccaa099-2
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.957
look at what what's going on and
then give them some kind of

bd30750e-8eac-4b38-8a9b-3ba15ccaa099-3
00:09:12.957 --> 00:09:16.785
unique analytics which we've
used in the past to you know,

bd30750e-8eac-4b38-8a9b-3ba15ccaa099-4
00:09:16.785 --> 00:09:20.677
and that help them evaluate
their position because a lot of

bd30750e-8eac-4b38-8a9b-3ba15ccaa099-5
00:09:20.677 --> 00:09:24.505
these are speculative trades
where the guys just you know,

bd30750e-8eac-4b38-8a9b-3ba15ccaa099-6
00:09:24.505 --> 00:09:27.360
kind of betting and these guys
aren't very.

e4808428-06eb-43a3-8242-db4d7f865e52-0
00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:36.171
Option savvy. So they just, you
know, buy an option knowing

e4808428-06eb-43a3-8242-db4d7f865e52-1
00:09:36.171 --> 00:09:41.964
that, oh, if I by, the worst I
can do is just lose the premium.

e4808428-06eb-43a3-8242-db4d7f865e52-2
00:09:41.964 --> 00:09:47.395
But I don't know anything beyond
that. And so we're kind of

e4808428-06eb-43a3-8242-db4d7f865e52-3
00:09:47.395 --> 00:09:52.826
hoping to educate them up a
little bit. All right. And then

e4808428-06eb-43a3-8242-db4d7f865e52-4
00:09:52.826 --> 00:09:55.180
vpm. Yeah. So this one is.

1604fa90-76be-456a-850e-fe04805f054c-0
00:09:55.540 --> 00:10:02.006
It's got multiple layers and
multiple iterations, so I kind

1604fa90-76be-456a-850e-fe04805f054c-1
00:10:02.006 --> 00:10:08.796
of hang on. Let me get out of
the full screen so I can explain

1604fa90-76be-456a-850e-fe04805f054c-2
00:10:08.796 --> 00:10:15.694
this a little better. The goal
here is to create a system where

1604fa90-76be-456a-850e-fe04805f054c-3
00:10:15.694 --> 00:10:18.820
brokers can enter trades and.

951f87c7-1b8d-4dce-a214-d474040373e5-0
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.466
A1 price and then charge a
different brokerage for a trade.

951f87c7-1b8d-4dce-a214-d474040373e5-1
00:10:28.466 --> 00:10:32.865
So right now what happens is
every trade we do with a

951f87c7-1b8d-4dce-a214-d474040373e5-2
00:10:32.865 --> 00:10:37.751
particular customer lines up to
a rate sheet. And that rate

951f87c7-1b8d-4dce-a214-d474040373e5-3
00:10:37.751 --> 00:10:42.801
sheet just says if this is a
corn contract, we will pay you X

951f87c7-1b8d-4dce-a214-d474040373e5-4
00:10:42.801 --> 00:10:48.095
number of dollars per number of
corn contracts that you paid for

951f87c7-1b8d-4dce-a214-d474040373e5-5
00:10:48.095 --> 00:10:48.339
us.

0720dcb1-44d1-496a-be08-c21f733a2baf-0
00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:55.455
Our system that we're building
here is to change it. So we're

0720dcb1-44d1-496a-be08-c21f733a2baf-1
00:10:55.455 --> 00:11:00.213
going to get you a better
execution price and then we're

0720dcb1-44d1-496a-be08-c21f733a2baf-2
00:11:00.213 --> 00:11:05.139
going to charge you a variable
rate for each trade that we

0720dcb1-44d1-496a-be08-c21f733a2baf-3
00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:10.314
execute for you. So it's like a
trade execution system and an

0720dcb1-44d1-496a-be08-c21f733a2baf-4
00:11:10.314 --> 00:11:14.822
accounting system and an
invoicing system all wrapped

0720dcb1-44d1-496a-be08-c21f733a2baf-5
00:11:14.822 --> 00:11:19.080
into one, and that's just phase
one. Phase two is.

0ddab67b-1bb7-419c-bf2c-802aa4977869-0
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:25.346
Building a system that an
automated market maker can

0ddab67b-1bb7-419c-bf2c-802aa4977869-1
00:11:25.346 --> 00:11:31.207
stream quotes to us against our
customers orders and then

0ddab67b-1bb7-419c-bf2c-802aa4977869-2
00:11:31.207 --> 00:11:37.574
automatically send trades to the
exchange. So there's a lot of

0ddab67b-1bb7-419c-bf2c-802aa4977869-3
00:11:37.574 --> 00:11:43.941
things there. I don't know how
much of that terminology that I

0ddab67b-1bb7-419c-bf2c-802aa4977869-4
00:11:43.941 --> 00:11:48.590
just said we need. Yeah, that
all made sense.

338f2fc3-ea53-4e16-b5fa-4abd6bca0e68-0
00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:55.952
At a high level, of course, but
sorry, hang on one SEC. Just

338f2fc3-ea53-4e16-b5fa-4abd6bca0e68-1
00:11:55.952 --> 00:12:02.334
taking some notes here. Sorry.
So where are yours? Where's your

338f2fc3-ea53-4e16-b5fa-4abd6bca0e68-2
00:12:02.334 --> 00:12:08.217
biggest priority? I mean,
you're, I mean, it just depends,

338f2fc3-ea53-4e16-b5fa-4abd6bca0e68-3
00:12:08.217 --> 00:12:14.000
I guess my thing is like, it
depends if you're telling me

338f2fc3-ea53-4e16-b5fa-4abd6bca0e68-4
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.481
like this variable pricing model
is gonna take us three years to

338f2fc3-ea53-4e16-b5fa-4abd6bca0e68-5
00:12:20.481 --> 00:12:21.080
build.

14bcaa05-4afa-465c-9731-fcaf15dc37c3-0
00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:26.426
Then I would say let's get some
of the other pieces done first.

14bcaa05-4afa-465c-9731-fcaf15dc37c3-1
00:12:26.426 --> 00:12:31.065
If you're saying like you know,
we think we can get this done in

14bcaa05-4afa-465c-9731-fcaf15dc37c3-2
00:12:31.065 --> 00:12:35.417
9 to 18 months, then I'd say
let's start on that. But again,

14bcaa05-4afa-465c-9731-fcaf15dc37c3-3
00:12:35.417 --> 00:12:39.842
I, I know we can't really give
an answer on that until we get

14bcaa05-4afa-465c-9731-fcaf15dc37c3-4
00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:43.980
into the weeds on it. So I
don't, I don't know if if like

14bcaa05-4afa-465c-9731-fcaf15dc37c3-5
00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.620
we should just get started on
working through the.

4dc1c865-c7ec-4068-a180-17a3e617ed4e-0
00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:51.912
Variable pricing model. And then
we'd be like, oh man, this thing

4dc1c865-c7ec-4068-a180-17a3e617ed4e-1
00:12:51.912 --> 00:12:55.418
is going to take us forever.
Like maybe we should put a pause

4dc1c865-c7ec-4068-a180-17a3e617ed4e-2
00:12:55.418 --> 00:12:58.981
in this. We've got like how much
time we think version one and

4dc1c865-c7ec-4068-a180-17a3e617ed4e-3
00:12:58.981 --> 00:13:02.600
version two are going to be and
then you know, we can come back

4dc1c865-c7ec-4068-a180-17a3e617ed4e-4
00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.767
and do some other things and
then come back for version

4dc1c865-c7ec-4068-a180-17a3e617ed4e-5
00:13:05.767 --> 00:13:08.877
three. Like I'm just, I'm not
quite sure what the best

4dc1c865-c7ec-4068-a180-17a3e617ed4e-6
00:13:08.877 --> 00:13:12.384
approach here is. Well, let me
throw an approach and you guys

4dc1c865-c7ec-4068-a180-17a3e617ed4e-7
00:13:12.384 --> 00:13:15.720
can beat it up. Vpm sense, it
can take a lot. It's also in

4dc1c865-c7ec-4068-a180-17a3e617ed4e-8
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.059
depth.

5aec229d-b319-4199-bf90-6ae1cf412aa4-0
00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:23.287
So might be better to start with
some other ones to you know get

5aec229d-b319-4199-bf90-6ae1cf412aa4-1
00:13:23.287 --> 00:13:28.812
the, the juices flowing. Yeah,
that's fine because they they

5aec229d-b319-4199-bf90-6ae1cf412aa4-2
00:13:28.812 --> 00:13:33.612
might be more more point
solutions I would say. Then

5aec229d-b319-4199-bf90-6ae1cf412aa4-3
00:13:33.612 --> 00:13:38.956
start with like axfinder, OK,
that was the next one on our

5aec229d-b319-4199-bf90-6ae1cf412aa4-4
00:13:38.956 --> 00:13:42.760
road map before we reach out to
you guys.

ed41eaa0-7f7a-49cb-bff6-c3f844411d09-0
00:13:45.510 --> 00:13:53.027
Okay, let's, let's do that then.
By the way, I can't help but

ed41eaa0-7f7a-49cb-bff6-c3f844411d09-1
00:13:53.027 --> 00:13:59.816
think of like axe the body
spray, just to be clear. All

ed41eaa0-7f7a-49cb-bff6-c3f844411d09-2
00:13:59.816 --> 00:14:06.727
right, let's jump into that. So
we talked about the, the

ed41eaa0-7f7a-49cb-bff6-c3f844411d09-3
00:14:06.727 --> 00:14:12.790
volatility, the, the volatility
dashboard, right?

3de34865-705e-4d67-87ef-4738ff718900-0
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:22.548
Not that we want to get into the
exact aspects of, you know, what

3de34865-705e-4d67-87ef-4738ff718900-1
00:14:22.548 --> 00:14:28.436
the screen would look like, but
if if we're oh, you can't see

3de34865-705e-4d67-87ef-4738ff718900-2
00:14:28.436 --> 00:14:33.565
the screen, hold on, stop
sharing and share the other

3de34865-705e-4d67-87ef-4738ff718900-3
00:14:33.565 --> 00:14:34.039
part.

db85b9a1-4c5f-471a-a17a-6c651572cde9-0
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:58.109
All right. So Andrew, nice job I
put this organize this our

db85b9a1-4c5f-471a-a17a-6c651572cde9-1
00:14:58.109 --> 00:15:07.674
craziness from earlier. Thank
you. So right now the volatility

db85b9a1-4c5f-471a-a17a-6c651572cde9-2
00:15:07.674 --> 00:15:16.480
data is really kind of stored
here right in product data.

61c6a447-32f1-4703-bffa-05d5b9d6b445-0
00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:26.601
No, no, it's stored in the oh,
go ahead, Scott. Yeah, probably

61c6a447-32f1-4703-bffa-05d5b9d6b445-1
00:15:26.601 --> 00:15:31.879
close to market data except
there we go. Basically it takes

61c6a447-32f1-4703-bffa-05d5b9d6b445-2
00:15:31.879 --> 00:15:37.333
market data as input and then
sort of does transformations on

61c6a447-32f1-4703-bffa-05d5b9d6b445-3
00:15:37.333 --> 00:15:40.940
it and gives new market data
coming out.

e2b9f13e-d489-4e55-8410-f9b51b48009e-0
00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:54.640
So maybe calculated market data?
Sure.

1bd8fc99-2c5b-48c8-a629-affdd63ca35e-0
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:13.506
Can you guys hear that noise
from me on behind me?

1bd8fc99-2c5b-48c8-a629-affdd63ca35e-1
00:17:13.506 --> 00:17:19.876
Absolutely. Yeah. It's
convenient construction across

1bd8fc99-2c5b-48c8-a629-affdd63ca35e-2
00:17:19.876 --> 00:17:26.482
the alley. All right. So if
that's that's can be stored

1bd8fc99-2c5b-48c8-a629-affdd63ca35e-3
00:17:26.482 --> 00:17:28.370
there, I get it.

a06ba4ec-8d2d-43ae-b5b2-c9a56b0d8aa5-0
00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:40.857
So when you are presenting data
to or information to the client,

a06ba4ec-8d2d-43ae-b5b2-c9a56b0d8aa5-1
00:17:40.857 --> 00:17:46.756
you have to store some of that
client details, right? A client

a06ba4ec-8d2d-43ae-b5b2-c9a56b0d8aa5-2
00:17:46.756 --> 00:17:52.563
will first of all they have to
log in. You're kind of waiting

a06ba4ec-8d2d-43ae-b5b2-c9a56b0d8aa5-3
00:17:52.563 --> 00:17:57.620
for a pause in this. It's not
going to happen, is it?

f13c963f-d1cd-419f-a594-12d9afe3f395-0
00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:11.013
Okay, no, all right. I'm just
going in. So just if I just

f13c963f-d1cd-419f-a594-12d9afe3f395-1
00:18:11.013 --> 00:18:14.768
think this through a little bit,
it sounds like you're going to

f13c963f-d1cd-419f-a594-12d9afe3f395-2
00:18:14.768 --> 00:18:18.405
the client that's going to log
in. The client's going to have

f13c963f-d1cd-419f-a594-12d9afe3f395-3
00:18:18.405 --> 00:18:21.574
to enter some of their
favorites. You know, pick pick

f13c963f-d1cd-419f-a594-12d9afe3f395-4
00:18:21.574 --> 00:18:25.270
what sort of products and and
and expressions are looking for,

f13c963f-d1cd-419f-a594-12d9afe3f395-5
00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:28.966
save their preferences and then
see their data. Are they going

f13c963f-d1cd-419f-a594-12d9afe3f395-6
00:18:28.966 --> 00:18:32.370
to get alerts as well? Draw this
out a little bit for me.

f45fab58-18b2-4a8c-b2ea-aef20b378a3e-0
00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.199
Mike, do you want to take that?
That seems like a sort of a road

f45fab58-18b2-4a8c-b2ea-aef20b378a3e-1
00:18:44.199 --> 00:18:47.435
map question. Sorry, say that
one more time. So with with Acts

f45fab58-18b2-4a8c-b2ea-aef20b378a3e-2
00:18:47.435 --> 00:18:50.004
Finder, I think I think what
you're saying from a

f45fab58-18b2-4a8c-b2ea-aef20b378a3e-3
00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:53.241
functionality standpoint is that
you're going to have a client

f45fab58-18b2-4a8c-b2ea-aef20b378a3e-4
00:18:53.241 --> 00:18:56.015
that's going to log in, they're
going to choose their

f45fab58-18b2-4a8c-b2ea-aef20b378a3e-5
00:18:56.015 --> 00:18:58.995
preferences like let's let's
just use the additional ball

f45fab58-18b2-4a8c-b2ea-aef20b378a3e-6
00:18:58.995 --> 00:19:02.180
dashboard as just a starting
point. They're going to, they're

f45fab58-18b2-4a8c-b2ea-aef20b378a3e-7
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.314
going to kind of go through that
and pick the ones that they

f45fab58-18b2-4a8c-b2ea-aef20b378a3e-8
00:19:05.314 --> 00:19:07.780
really like. We have to save
those preferences.

9786da66-b7df-4886-a02b-3eaaa3378eac-0
00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:13.981
And then and then what happens
from there? Are they setting up

9786da66-b7df-4886-a02b-3eaaa3378eac-1
00:19:13.981 --> 00:19:19.633
notifications with price changes
or volatility changes? Are we

9786da66-b7df-4886-a02b-3eaaa3378eac-2
00:19:19.633 --> 00:19:24.925
recalculating data based on
their preferences? The data is

9786da66-b7df-4886-a02b-3eaaa3378eac-3
00:19:24.925 --> 00:19:29.770
calculated just constantly, so
no to that second one.

dd4a1b74-2717-4622-8c38-915e114637b9-0
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.485
Their preferences would be
saved. So like if they were just

dd4a1b74-2717-4622-8c38-915e114637b9-1
00:19:35.485 --> 00:19:39.638
a corn trader and they right now
we have got every single product

dd4a1b74-2717-4622-8c38-915e114637b9-2
00:19:39.638 --> 00:19:43.602
or what are we asking like 12
products right now. If they were

dd4a1b74-2717-4622-8c38-915e114637b9-3
00:19:43.602 --> 00:19:47.440
just want to look at corn, we
would just you know be able to

dd4a1b74-2717-4622-8c38-915e114637b9-4
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.153
filter and save that so they
wouldn't have to see anything

dd4a1b74-2717-4622-8c38-915e114637b9-5
00:19:51.153 --> 00:19:54.928
else they didn't want to. And
then basically there would be

dd4a1b74-2717-4622-8c38-915e114637b9-6
00:19:54.928 --> 00:19:58.200
another panel on next to the
right next to the ball

dd4a1b74-2717-4622-8c38-915e114637b9-7
00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:58.829
dashboard.

ad636c2f-6679-459a-80ad-93aa8fa46a43-0
00:20:00.130 --> 00:20:04.571
That would have the action items
based off of the data that

ad636c2f-6679-459a-80ad-93aa8fa46a43-1
00:20:04.571 --> 00:20:09.309
they're seeing, the action items
help me understand that action

ad636c2f-6679-459a-80ad-93aa8fa46a43-2
00:20:09.309 --> 00:20:14.195
items. So the action items would
be like, I am looking at like so

ad636c2f-6679-459a-80ad-93aa8fa46a43-3
00:20:14.195 --> 00:20:18.785
sorry, oh wait, go back to your
earlier question, dude. Would

ad636c2f-6679-459a-80ad-93aa8fa46a43-4
00:20:18.785 --> 00:20:23.449
there be alerts? Like yes, we'd
love to have alerts there like

ad636c2f-6679-459a-80ad-93aa8fa46a43-5
00:20:23.449 --> 00:20:27.669
hey if corn volatility front
month, corn volatility goes

ad636c2f-6679-459a-80ad-93aa8fa46a43-6
00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:28.410
below 27%.

acfe9750-ec62-4b3f-9d83-a86f44a28b26-0
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:34.314
Send me an alert like great. We
also were looking at like do you

acfe9750-ec62-4b3f-9d83-a86f44a28b26-1
00:20:34.314 --> 00:20:39.365
want to look at the so the a
good measure of volatility in

acfe9750-ec62-4b3f-9d83-a86f44a28b26-2
00:20:39.365 --> 00:20:44.672
the trading spheres to buy a
straddle which is 2 at the money

acfe9750-ec62-4b3f-9d83-a86f44a28b26-3
00:20:44.672 --> 00:20:49.723
options of the same strike and
so that would be one of the

acfe9750-ec62-4b3f-9d83-a86f44a28b26-4
00:20:49.723 --> 00:20:55.117
action items that would be on
the right side is like I want to

acfe9750-ec62-4b3f-9d83-a86f44a28b26-5
00:20:55.117 --> 00:20:56.230
buy you know.

002f43db-994d-4fc9-a312-89b07b61f9e3-0
00:20:56.620 --> 00:21:01.905
Volatility and it would price up
the at the money straddled and

002f43db-994d-4fc9-a312-89b07b61f9e3-1
00:21:01.905 --> 00:21:07.025
that would be something that you
could view on this dashboard

002f43db-994d-4fc9-a312-89b07b61f9e3-2
00:21:07.025 --> 00:21:12.145
that would be at like you know
the top of the page. I guess I

002f43db-994d-4fc9-a312-89b07b61f9e3-3
00:21:12.145 --> 00:21:17.596
haven't fully worked out how the
UI would work for this as far as

002f43db-994d-4fc9-a312-89b07b61f9e3-4
00:21:17.596 --> 00:21:22.468
versus like the hot trades
versus the ball dashboard view,

002f43db-994d-4fc9-a312-89b07b61f9e3-5
00:21:22.468 --> 00:21:23.460
but I guess.

5d56fdb6-5461-4576-ae46-b4cfe68d1331-0
00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:28.292
Like I said, if someone can give
me some multiple choice

5d56fdb6-5461-4576-ae46-b4cfe68d1331-1
00:21:28.292 --> 00:21:33.071
questions on what they think the
best way for that to work, I

5d56fdb6-5461-4576-ae46-b4cfe68d1331-2
00:21:33.071 --> 00:21:37.926
would be very interested here.
So the I'm sorry these would be

5d56fdb6-5461-4576-ae46-b4cfe68d1331-3
00:21:37.926 --> 00:21:42.319
proposed strategies so that the
yeah we were just having

5d56fdb6-5461-4576-ae46-b4cfe68d1331-4
00:21:42.319 --> 00:21:46.789
throttle or caller or predefined
strategies that would be

5d56fdb6-5461-4576-ae46-b4cfe68d1331-5
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:50.180
available for for our customers
to look at.

0f160168-bbed-4dbd-8a2a-1773b0ce16a8-0
00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:11.829
So just to throw out a proposed
implementation here, I would

0f160168-bbed-4dbd-8a2a-1773b0ce16a8-1
00:22:11.829 --> 00:22:18.157
sort of see something like this
working, like right click on a a

0f160168-bbed-4dbd-8a2a-1773b0ce16a8-2
00:22:18.157 --> 00:22:24.097
line of the ball dashboard which
is going to correspond to a

0f160168-bbed-4dbd-8a2a-1773b0ce16a8-3
00:22:24.097 --> 00:22:29.744
particular product and contract
date and then you'll have

0f160168-bbed-4dbd-8a2a-1773b0ce16a8-4
00:22:29.744 --> 00:22:31.010
options like.

ba41d179-fca4-4520-b944-d94df2fee526-0
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:41.337
Send, straddle the hot trades,
set alert, something like that

ba41d179-fca4-4520-b944-d94df2fee526-1
00:22:41.337 --> 00:22:50.484
and then we would probably have
a different view for kind of

ba41d179-fca4-4520-b944-d94df2fee526-2
00:22:50.484 --> 00:23:00.381
the, the focus stuff that people
want to get alerts or sort of be

ba41d179-fca4-4520-b944-d94df2fee526-3
00:23:00.381 --> 00:23:06.230
tracking more granular
information on.

f3e42e0b-0691-486c-8714-e97829c8c690-0
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:12.815
And Scott, the the set send
startle to hot trades, the buy

f3e42e0b-0691-486c-8714-e97829c8c690-1
00:23:12.815 --> 00:23:17.329
volatility, the set alerts,
those would be all the different

f3e42e0b-0691-486c-8714-e97829c8c690-2
00:23:17.329 --> 00:23:21.842
action items that Michael you
are referring to, right? Yeah,

f3e42e0b-0691-486c-8714-e97829c8c690-3
00:23:21.842 --> 00:23:26.504
the clients, well the clients
have different types of products

f3e42e0b-0691-486c-8714-e97829c8c690-4
00:23:26.504 --> 00:23:30.944
too or is it just be like this
client just deals with corn,

f3e42e0b-0691-486c-8714-e97829c8c690-5
00:23:30.944 --> 00:23:33.089
this one just deals with oil?

49363d56-270e-45ec-a548-f70859bebb4a-0
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:45.799
It's actually per trader that
preferences would be distributed

49363d56-270e-45ec-a548-f70859bebb4a-1
00:23:45.799 --> 00:23:53.941
okay or saved. And in general
probably I'm a little bit

49363d56-270e-45ec-a548-f70859bebb4a-2
00:23:53.941 --> 00:24:03.100
guessing here, so Mike, tell me
if I'm off base here, but like

49363d56-270e-45ec-a548-f70859bebb4a-3
00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:06.590
probably clients have a.

cd19823f-b7f2-428f-a884-c7d02c34c7ec-0
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:11.783
A few products or a set of
products that sort of their

cd19823f-b7f2-428f-a884-c7d02c34c7ec-1
00:24:11.783 --> 00:24:16.953
interest is most interested in,
but it's not necessarily easily

cd19823f-b7f2-428f-a884-c7d02c34c7ec-2
00:24:16.953 --> 00:24:21.880
like defined. It's kind of a
user level thing. You know like

cd19823f-b7f2-428f-a884-c7d02c34c7ec-3
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:26.646
like if the person, like one
person might be purely a corn

cd19823f-b7f2-428f-a884-c7d02c34c7ec-4
00:24:26.646 --> 00:24:31.493
trader, they don't care about
anything but corn. One person

cd19823f-b7f2-428f-a884-c7d02c34c7ec-5
00:24:31.493 --> 00:24:36.260
might be sort of a a more
complete agricultural or grains.

95e7fa4a-9b0d-4766-8344-d7c28e140dbe-0
00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:40.804
Say like sector focus, so they
might care about all of the

95e7fa4a-9b0d-4766-8344-d7c28e140dbe-1
00:24:40.804 --> 00:24:44.965
grain products, but say not care
about crude oil at all. You

95e7fa4a-9b0d-4766-8344-d7c28e140dbe-2
00:24:44.965 --> 00:24:49.127
might have an ethanol trader
that cares about corn and crude

95e7fa4a-9b0d-4766-8344-d7c28e140dbe-3
00:24:49.127 --> 00:24:53.356
oil and ethanol, but not any of
the other things. So probably

95e7fa4a-9b0d-4766-8344-d7c28e140dbe-4
00:24:53.356 --> 00:24:57.517
the clean, cleanest way to to
model it is just a trader gets

95e7fa4a-9b0d-4766-8344-d7c28e140dbe-5
00:24:57.517 --> 00:25:01.678
to set what products they want
to be looking at at any given

95e7fa4a-9b0d-4766-8344-d7c28e140dbe-6
00:25:01.678 --> 00:25:02.020
time.

40b8c7ea-87d5-4991-a401-b7bf9b009e7b-0
00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:13.372
Yeah, it might be, it might be
more than financial instruments,

40b8c7ea-87d5-4991-a401-b7bf9b009e7b-1
00:25:13.372 --> 00:25:19.150
right? It might. They might want
to have a hot trade at a product

40b8c7ea-87d5-4991-a401-b7bf9b009e7b-2
00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:23.702
level. A hot trade would
probably be at the product

40b8c7ea-87d5-4991-a401-b7bf9b009e7b-3
00:25:23.702 --> 00:25:29.392
product contract date level. And
then there'd be a few different

40b8c7ea-87d5-4991-a401-b7bf9b009e7b-4
00:25:29.392 --> 00:25:33.770
categories. So like the most
basic ones would be.

757507af-eb14-422d-a897-613b97266740-0
00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:40.275
If you want to do a ball trade,
you do a straddle. If you want

757507af-eb14-422d-a897-613b97266740-1
00:25:40.275 --> 00:25:44.570
to do a skew trade, you do a
risk reversal or it's really

757507af-eb14-422d-a897-613b97266740-2
00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:49.309
kind of what were you thinking,
Mike? We had like a a matrix of

757507af-eb14-422d-a897-613b97266740-3
00:25:49.309 --> 00:25:54.123
like are you bullish or bearish
on price and volatility. So that

757507af-eb14-422d-a897-613b97266740-4
00:25:54.123 --> 00:25:58.714
gives you 4 four boxes and those
are basically the four trade

757507af-eb14-422d-a897-613b97266740-5
00:25:58.714 --> 00:26:01.009
items that you'll be suggested.

303a055d-6c76-4da1-9df6-3f7e3e18b213-0
00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:07.506
And it was, it was what was
bullish or bearish underlying

303a055d-6c76-4da1-9df6-3f7e3e18b213-1
00:26:07.506 --> 00:26:13.025
and then bullish or bearish
volatility as well and that

303a055d-6c76-4da1-9df6-3f7e3e18b213-2
00:26:13.025 --> 00:26:19.136
would give you risk reversals
and straddles. I'm sorry, there

303a055d-6c76-4da1-9df6-3f7e3e18b213-3
00:26:19.136 --> 00:26:25.148
was three, right, it was bulls
bear skew volatility and just

303a055d-6c76-4da1-9df6-3f7e3e18b213-4
00:26:25.148 --> 00:26:29.190
underlying. OK, so that gives us
6 by 6.

6244571a-14c5-42fb-8cd9-0f1e7fe164c4-0
00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:44.597
So 36 different suggested
trades, yeah, say those again,

6244571a-14c5-42fb-8cd9-0f1e7fe164c4-1
00:26:44.597 --> 00:26:58.248
bullish and bearish on
underlying price volatility and

6244571a-14c5-42fb-8cd9-0f1e7fe164c4-2
00:26:58.248 --> 00:26:59.490
skew.

b782b261-ab19-482e-bf70-a5f1e4f9ae35-0
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:15.408
This is awesome. OK, which
that's our options. That's like

b782b261-ab19-482e-bf70-a5f1e4f9ae35-1
00:27:15.408 --> 00:27:27.202
too big to fit in a right click
menu. I guess we could have.

b782b261-ab19-482e-bf70-a5f1e4f9ae35-2
00:27:27.202 --> 00:27:31.650
Don't worry about that.

b3293667-7aa6-4f12-9f91-23e5dc74caff-0
00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:40.985
Yeah. But you said there's a
matrix. Yeah. So essentially

b3293667-7aa6-4f12-9f91-23e5dc74caff-1
00:27:40.985 --> 00:27:48.046
what we listed there is 6
different. What is it? No. OK.

b3293667-7aa6-4f12-9f91-23e5dc74caff-2
00:27:48.046 --> 00:27:55.479
So three different things. You
can be bullish or bearish on

b3293667-7aa6-4f12-9f91-23e5dc74caff-3
00:27:55.479 --> 00:28:02.788
each of them. Oh, so you're
saying it's bullish or bearish

b3293667-7aa6-4f12-9f91-23e5dc74caff-4
00:28:02.788 --> 00:28:03.160
on.

6c4682e3-76e7-4145-b61d-7eb2385b8008-0
00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:09.127
Yeah, like that. Actually, it's
not even a grid, right? It's. Am

6c4682e3-76e7-4145-b61d-7eb2385b8008-1
00:28:09.127 --> 00:28:13.287
I right? That's gonna be a
three-dimensional thing. No, no,

6c4682e3-76e7-4145-b61d-7eb2385b8008-2
00:28:13.287 --> 00:28:17.864
I'm missing the third dimension.
I thought we had the the. It was

6c4682e3-76e7-4145-b61d-7eb2385b8008-3
00:28:17.864 --> 00:28:22.093
just like wasn't one of the
implementations. Just like there

6c4682e3-76e7-4145-b61d-7eb2385b8008-4
00:28:22.093 --> 00:28:26.323
would be 3 buttons next to the
row and it would be like, you

6c4682e3-76e7-4145-b61d-7eb2385b8008-5
00:28:26.323 --> 00:28:28.820
click it once and it would be
like.

bca7f366-78fe-4716-bdd7-3b85dfc5f87d-0
00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.225
Red or you know, green for
bullish, red for bearish and

bca7f366-78fe-4716-bdd7-3b85dfc5f87d-1
00:28:32.225 --> 00:28:35.608
just neutral. If you just didn't
have an opinion, right? Like

bca7f366-78fe-4716-bdd7-3b85dfc5f87d-2
00:28:35.608 --> 00:28:38.772
that was the that was the
simplest way to do it. And then

bca7f366-78fe-4716-bdd7-3b85dfc5f87d-3
00:28:38.772 --> 00:28:42.100
you just had underlying price
volatility in skew, right? You

bca7f366-78fe-4716-bdd7-3b85dfc5f87d-4
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.538
just had three buttons and it
was just like how many times you

bca7f366-78fe-4716-bdd7-3b85dfc5f87d-5
00:28:45.538 --> 00:28:49.030
click the button that determined
what you wanted to do and then

bca7f366-78fe-4716-bdd7-3b85dfc5f87d-6
00:28:49.030 --> 00:28:52.249
you click like save once you had
it all sorted out, do you

bca7f366-78fe-4716-bdd7-3b85dfc5f87d-7
00:28:52.249 --> 00:28:54.650
remember that or am I just
picking that up?

3e1609b5-f09f-4150-8a0c-619f1419e8d9-0
00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:00.715
I, I like, I remember talking
about this and at like the level

3e1609b5-f09f-4150-8a0c-619f1419e8d9-1
00:29:00.715 --> 00:29:04.057
of UI granularity, but I don't
really remember the details of

3e1609b5-f09f-4150-8a0c-619f1419e8d9-2
00:29:04.057 --> 00:29:07.453
what we decided or talked about
the simplest implementation of

3e1609b5-f09f-4150-8a0c-619f1419e8d9-3
00:29:07.453 --> 00:29:10.957
it. But if there's a, if anyone
can think of anything easier on,

3e1609b5-f09f-4150-8a0c-619f1419e8d9-4
00:29:10.957 --> 00:29:14.461
yeah, we can get to mark on the
UI. I just wanna be sure that we

3e1609b5-f09f-4150-8a0c-619f1419e8d9-5
00:29:14.461 --> 00:29:17.533
have all the right options. Do
we need a neutral as well

3e1609b5-f09f-4150-8a0c-619f1419e8d9-6
00:29:17.533 --> 00:29:20.929
because we've got bullish and
bearish on here and do we need a

3e1609b5-f09f-4150-8a0c-619f1419e8d9-7
00:29:20.929 --> 00:29:24.325
neutral also? Well, that would
just be like the default is you

3e1609b5-f09f-4150-8a0c-619f1419e8d9-8
00:29:24.325 --> 00:29:26.320
just don't have an opinion. So
yeah.

a86c411c-a4e8-4bd3-b7f4-1f3aad73b5dc-0
00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:35.361
I think we do need it. Yeah. OK
Demark's taking notes because I

a86c411c-a4e8-4bd3-b7f4-1f3aad73b5dc-1
00:29:35.361 --> 00:29:43.346
think you're right, Scott. It
makes for a large right click if

a86c411c-a4e8-4bd3-b7f4-1f3aad73b5dc-2
00:29:43.346 --> 00:29:49.430
you do something like that. It's
not realistic.

af369988-39a8-4e7b-ab48-4eabbbdfc880-0
00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:03.949
OK. So then based on your market
opinion and that that market

af369988-39a8-4e7b-ab48-4eabbbdfc880-1
00:30:03.949 --> 00:30:09.670
opinion will be based on that
that instrument right or that or

af369988-39a8-4e7b-ab48-4eabbbdfc880-2
00:30:09.670 --> 00:30:15.300
that product maybe changes to a
product, right, it would be a

af369988-39a8-4e7b-ab48-4eabbbdfc880-3
00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:20.476
product and contract date
specific opinion. So I I don't

af369988-39a8-4e7b-ab48-4eabbbdfc880-4
00:30:20.476 --> 00:30:26.105
know just to make sure everybody
is what I'm talking about so

af369988-39a8-4e7b-ab48-4eabbbdfc880-5
00:30:26.105 --> 00:30:26.559
like.

45d035b0-5a8f-4385-ad49-e4e21a90efd5-0
00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:32.866
The corn regular options would
be an example of the product and

45d035b0-5a8f-4385-ad49-e4e21a90efd5-1
00:30:32.866 --> 00:30:37.996
then the December corn regular
options would be an example of

45d035b0-5a8f-4385-ad49-e4e21a90efd5-2
00:30:37.996 --> 00:30:43.044
the product contract date pair
right. But is is that we were

45d035b0-5a8f-4385-ad49-e4e21a90efd5-3
00:30:43.044 --> 00:30:48.092
talking last time that how fans
instruments include contract

45d035b0-5a8f-4385-ad49-e4e21a90efd5-4
00:30:48.092 --> 00:30:52.643
date. Yeah so it's a it's an
opinion that crosses over

45d035b0-5a8f-4385-ad49-e4e21a90efd5-5
00:30:52.643 --> 00:30:54.050
multiple strikes.

b3d8cbd5-7f9e-4706-8abe-03270e1a7516-0
00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:59.756
But not across multiple contract
dates. I mean, you could I guess

b3d8cbd5-7f9e-4706-8abe-03270e1a7516-1
00:30:59.756 --> 00:31:04.092
have like be want to do a buy in
all of the contract dates at the

b3d8cbd5-7f9e-4706-8abe-03270e1a7516-2
00:31:04.092 --> 00:31:08.034
same time. But I'm with you.
Yeah, I'm just putting that up

b3d8cbd5-7f9e-4706-8abe-03270e1a7516-3
00:31:08.034 --> 00:31:09.020
here for later.

94858cfa-65fc-41a3-829a-643215381c22-0
00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:31.542
I guess maybe I should just
introduce a little bit of a

94858cfa-65fc-41a3-829a-643215381c22-1
00:31:31.542 --> 00:31:37.449
hierarchy there. So usually when
I talk about this kind of thing,

94858cfa-65fc-41a3-829a-643215381c22-2
00:31:37.449 --> 00:31:41.834
there are two sort of
hierarchies that you could

94858cfa-65fc-41a3-829a-643215381c22-3
00:31:41.834 --> 00:31:47.294
conceivably look at. So one is
kind of what we mostly talked

94858cfa-65fc-41a3-829a-643215381c22-4
00:31:47.294 --> 00:31:52.127
about here, which is there's
products and then within

94858cfa-65fc-41a3-829a-643215381c22-5
00:31:52.127 --> 00:31:55.170
products you have contract
dates.

2c187d6f-d7b0-4252-b0c6-1eb1ba5ca58d-0
00:31:56.030 --> 00:32:03.096
Within each contract date you
have strikes. Within each strike

2c187d6f-d7b0-4252-b0c6-1eb1ba5ca58d-1
00:32:03.096 --> 00:32:09.937
you have rights, a right being
either a call or a put. And I

2c187d6f-d7b0-4252-b0c6-1eb1ba5ca58d-2
00:32:09.937 --> 00:32:16.779
would usually well. And then
there's another hierarchy which

2c187d6f-d7b0-4252-b0c6-1eb1ba5ca58d-3
00:32:16.779 --> 00:32:23.733
is product Group, one second.
Let me get this one first here,

2c187d6f-d7b0-4252-b0c6-1eb1ba5ca58d-4
00:32:23.733 --> 00:32:24.070
OK?

1203281a-b504-4ab6-8cd9-e022d177f9ab-0
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:58.672
And then the other hierarchy is
product, group, tenor,

1203281a-b504-4ab6-8cd9-e022d177f9ab-1
00:32:58.672 --> 00:33:07.512
expiration, strike, right? Tenor
is sort of a made-up word.

1203281a-b504-4ab6-8cd9-e022d177f9ab-2
00:33:07.512 --> 00:33:16.940
There's not a commonly accepted
term for this as far as I know,

1203281a-b504-4ab6-8cd9-e022d177f9ab-3
00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:21.950
but what it means is
essentially.

1566423f-aeba-4956-be4a-fcbd8a24c360-0
00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:26.399
What underlying are you looking
at? So like the corn, corn

1566423f-aeba-4956-be4a-fcbd8a24c360-1
00:33:26.399 --> 00:33:30.423
options, for instance, there's a
number of different underlying

1566423f-aeba-4956-be4a-fcbd8a24c360-2
00:33:30.423 --> 00:33:34.383
there could be a Dee's future,
it could be a March future, you

1566423f-aeba-4956-be4a-fcbd8a24c360-3
00:33:34.383 --> 00:33:38.156
know, whatever. And then the
sort of screwy thing about the

1566423f-aeba-4956-be4a-fcbd8a24c360-4
00:33:38.156 --> 00:33:41.928
way that they organize this
stuff in the other hierarchy is

1566423f-aeba-4956-be4a-fcbd8a24c360-5
00:33:41.928 --> 00:33:45.889
that you can have options that
have the same underlying in two

1566423f-aeba-4956-be4a-fcbd8a24c360-6
00:33:45.889 --> 00:33:49.472
different products. So for
instance, a corn weekly and a

1566423f-aeba-4956-be4a-fcbd8a24c360-7
00:33:49.472 --> 00:33:50.290
corn regular.

711a0760-fd99-4097-8223-2ea2e8832f81-0
00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:56.635
Could have the same underlying.
So it's sort of with one of

711a0760-fd99-4097-8223-2ea2e8832f81-1
00:33:56.635 --> 00:34:01.774
those you use depends whether
you're you're more concerned

711a0760-fd99-4097-8223-2ea2e8832f81-2
00:34:01.774 --> 00:34:06.913
with like looking at products
sort of as your sort of your

711a0760-fd99-4097-8223-2ea2e8832f81-3
00:34:06.913 --> 00:34:12.226
your higher level split or like
your underlying as your your

711a0760-fd99-4097-8223-2ea2e8832f81-4
00:34:12.226 --> 00:34:17.713
higher level split. Is that only
for future options? Yeah well

711a0760-fd99-4097-8223-2ea2e8832f81-5
00:34:17.713 --> 00:34:18.410
sort of.

c2bfa7ff-56f6-4627-a825-d52d8c738593-0
00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:24.492
So equity options don't
generally do this because they

c2bfa7ff-56f6-4627-a825-d52d8c738593-1
00:34:24.492 --> 00:34:28.881
don't have different different
stocks or whatever, but indexes

c2bfa7ff-56f6-4627-a825-d52d8c738593-2
00:34:28.881 --> 00:34:32.922
index options are more like
futures options than they are

c2bfa7ff-56f6-4627-a825-d52d8c738593-3
00:34:32.922 --> 00:34:37.381
like equity options, even though
they seem, and even though the

c2bfa7ff-56f6-4627-a825-d52d8c738593-4
00:34:37.381 --> 00:34:41.283
sort of similarity seems like it
goes more in the other

c2bfa7ff-56f6-4627-a825-d52d8c738593-5
00:34:41.283 --> 00:34:41.980
direction.

303a8b7c-871a-4bba-896b-86e8a662a1db-0
00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:58.124
Quick question on the
expiration, if I can. You

303a8b7c-871a-4bba-896b-86e8a662a1db-1
00:34:58.124 --> 00:35:05.412
reference contract date and you
reference to expiration, are

303a8b7c-871a-4bba-896b-86e8a662a1db-2
00:35:05.412 --> 00:35:12.820
they interchangeable and which
one should we use? So contract

303a8b7c-871a-4bba-896b-86e8a662a1db-3
00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:19.750
date right yeah well so the IT
depends a little bit what.

53d6301a-fd6a-48ac-8c14-523a9073ddee-0
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:29.646
Hierarchy you're working with.
So if you're in hierarchy 1,

53d6301a-fd6a-48ac-8c14-523a9073ddee-1
00:35:29.646 --> 00:35:37.542
expiration and contract date are
equivalent. You can turn a

53d6301a-fd6a-48ac-8c14-523a9073ddee-2
00:35:37.542 --> 00:35:45.570
expiration into a contract date,
and vice versa if you're in

53d6301a-fd6a-48ac-8c14-523a9073ddee-3
00:35:45.570 --> 00:35:47.150
hierarchy 2.

a54774fc-16af-4efd-82a8-fec9687ce558-0
00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:55.731
You also need to know the tenor
to translate between expiration

a54774fc-16af-4efd-82a8-fec9687ce558-1
00:35:55.731 --> 00:36:01.142
and contract date. That's might
not even be true. You need.

a54774fc-16af-4efd-82a8-fec9687ce558-2
00:36:01.142 --> 00:36:07.094
Yeah, probably. Also there might
in hierarchy too. There might be

a54774fc-16af-4efd-82a8-fec9687ce558-3
00:36:07.094 --> 00:36:12.325
multiple expirations that have
the same contract date but

a54774fc-16af-4efd-82a8-fec9687ce558-4
00:36:12.325 --> 00:36:14.760
different expiration dates.

28e57b21-ab0e-4622-bbff-b54bff3317a6-0
00:36:28.350 --> 00:36:32.857
But probably, yeah, I think
expiration is probably the way

28e57b21-ab0e-4622-bbff-b54bff3317a6-1
00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:37.136
to go. Like those market
opinions we were talking about

28e57b21-ab0e-4622-bbff-b54bff3317a6-2
00:36:37.136 --> 00:36:41.950
below, I was sort of conceiving
them as being expiration level

28e57b21-ab0e-4622-bbff-b54bff3317a6-3
00:36:41.950 --> 00:36:46.534
opinions. Whether you're in a
hierarchy one or hierarchy 2,

28e57b21-ab0e-4622-bbff-b54bff3317a6-4
00:36:46.534 --> 00:36:51.118
they're, they're, they're the
same sort of once you hit the

28e57b21-ab0e-4622-bbff-b54bff3317a6-5
00:36:51.118 --> 00:36:54.709
expiration level, they're the
same non noness.

9e072dfc-4394-4eae-945e-73fbde8b63e7-0
00:37:06.350 --> 00:37:11.612
So down here when we're talking
about the hot trades, are we

9e072dfc-4394-4eae-945e-73fbde8b63e7-1
00:37:11.612 --> 00:37:16.874
needing the product and the
contract date or the product and

9e072dfc-4394-4eae-945e-73fbde8b63e7-2
00:37:16.874 --> 00:37:21.964
the expiration. So I mean you
really get both like I would

9e072dfc-4394-4eae-945e-73fbde8b63e7-3
00:37:21.964 --> 00:37:22.310
say.

6f008f81-68b9-4509-ac40-142ee7800a28-0
00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:27.192
I know. I think that picky, but
the computer won't know the

6f008f81-68b9-4509-ac40-142ee7800a28-1
00:37:27.192 --> 00:37:30.946
difference when we start to
program it. Yeah, so we also

6f008f81-68b9-4509-ac40-142ee7800a28-2
00:37:30.946 --> 00:37:35.162
have, we've also got some like
overlapping terminology here. So

6f008f81-68b9-4509-ac40-142ee7800a28-3
00:37:35.162 --> 00:37:38.983
like in one sense, you can talk
about an expiration as an

6f008f81-68b9-4509-ac40-142ee7800a28-4
00:37:38.983 --> 00:37:43.264
entity, which is sort of like a
node in your relationship graph.

6f008f81-68b9-4509-ac40-142ee7800a28-5
00:37:43.264 --> 00:37:47.085
You can also talk about an
expiration date, which is like

6f008f81-68b9-4509-ac40-142ee7800a28-6
00:37:47.085 --> 00:37:49.720
the actual date that an option
expires.

682acdf7-1d50-4703-a1e1-2f21d3b7ce0c-0
00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:55.048
Which would be a property of the
expiration entity. And then you

682acdf7-1d50-4703-a1e1-2f21d3b7ce0c-1
00:37:55.048 --> 00:37:58.898
can kind of like, if you're not
being careful with your

682acdf7-1d50-4703-a1e1-2f21d3b7ce0c-2
00:37:58.898 --> 00:38:03.160
language, you sort of have the
same issue with contract date.

682acdf7-1d50-4703-a1e1-2f21d3b7ce0c-3
00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.354
Like you could be talking about
the contract date as sort of

682acdf7-1d50-4703-a1e1-2f21d3b7ce0c-4
00:38:07.354 --> 00:38:11.272
describing the node in your
hierarchy, or you could talk

682acdf7-1d50-4703-a1e1-2f21d3b7ce0c-5
00:38:11.272 --> 00:38:15.260
about it as being the actual
value itself, but expiration

682acdf7-1d50-4703-a1e1-2f21d3b7ce0c-6
00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:19.316
node is probably the like the
one that we're talking about

682acdf7-1d50-4703-a1e1-2f21d3b7ce0c-7
00:38:19.316 --> 00:38:19.660
here.

b78a963d-18c5-4bb1-9a18-1a4a6d0d661e-0
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.470
And then once you have your
expiration node, you'd be able

b78a963d-18c5-4bb1-9a18-1a4a6d0d661e-1
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:32.033
to have, you know, be able to
sort of traverse the graph to

b78a963d-18c5-4bb1-9a18-1a4a6d0d661e-2
00:38:32.033 --> 00:38:37.875
sort of figure out those other
things. And then also you would

b78a963d-18c5-4bb1-9a18-1a4a6d0d661e-3
00:38:37.875 --> 00:38:43.716
have both the contract date and
the expiration date as part of

b78a963d-18c5-4bb1-9a18-1a4a6d0d661e-4
00:38:43.716 --> 00:38:48.723
the properties of that
expiration node. Randy Parker,

b78a963d-18c5-4bb1-9a18-1a4a6d0d661e-5
00:38:48.723 --> 00:38:51.320
Scott, does that make sense?

a73dd3f1-1993-4784-a929-e8e38debe8b9-0
00:38:54.510 --> 00:39:00.449
Yeah. One other thing I should
have mentioned. Does everyone

a73dd3f1-1993-4784-a929-e8e38debe8b9-1
00:39:00.449 --> 00:39:06.000
know what I what I'm talking
about when I say a graph, a

a73dd3f1-1993-4784-a929-e8e38debe8b9-2
00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:12.232
graph is in graph theory, not as
in like a a plot of data graph

a73dd3f1-1993-4784-a929-e8e38debe8b9-3
00:39:12.232 --> 00:39:17.782
database. Yeah. So Denise, I
know I'm still struggling a

a73dd3f1-1993-4784-a929-e8e38debe8b9-4
00:39:17.782 --> 00:39:22.748
little bit with the with the
product and financial

a73dd3f1-1993-4784-a929-e8e38debe8b9-5
00:39:22.748 --> 00:39:27.520
instrument, but I'm I'm
comfortable enough that.

5c2a0005-ab2d-4405-a985-5395edc56f9f-0
00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:35.052
I can release some notes and
come back and we can speak that

5c2a0005-ab2d-4405-a985-5395edc56f9f-1
00:39:35.052 --> 00:39:39.837
up. In other words, I wouldn't.
I don't want to spend too much

5c2a0005-ab2d-4405-a985-5395edc56f9f-2
00:39:39.837 --> 00:39:44.622
time on that if at the expense
of some other stuff. No, I get,

5c2a0005-ab2d-4405-a985-5395edc56f9f-3
00:39:44.622 --> 00:39:49.330
I get it. I just want to be sure
that Scott, Randy and Parker

5c2a0005-ab2d-4405-a985-5395edc56f9f-4
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:53.660
were as well. So. But I think
we're good. All right. So.

a35435de-8605-4250-ad40-239a42f5d02f-0
00:39:58.350 --> 00:40:15.946
Post strategies, just talk about
that in a bit. So here we're

a35435de-8605-4250-ad40-239a42f5d02f-1
00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:31.840
talking about straddles and the
whole like collars and.

0419f89d-63b8-48b2-a83b-094454b369ce-0
00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:47.442
Michael, what do you, you
mentioned if you a few

0419f89d-63b8-48b2-a83b-094454b369ce-1
00:40:47.442 --> 00:40:54.038
strategies risk reverse, yeah,
there's a straddle of risk

0419f89d-63b8-48b2-a83b-094454b369ce-2
00:40:54.038 --> 00:41:01.202
reversal. There's a three-way
embarrassed 3 way. I think those

0419f89d-63b8-48b2-a83b-094454b369ce-3
00:41:01.202 --> 00:41:07.230
are the main ones we want to go
with three-way what?

12d20087-3150-48b7-bac5-d4e87c6dbf32-0
00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:19.187
Bullish 3 way, Embarrass 3 way.
OK. And so those would be based

12d20087-3150-48b7-bac5-d4e87c6dbf32-1
00:41:19.187 --> 00:41:28.726
on what they chose for their
market opinion. It would propose

12d20087-3150-48b7-bac5-d4e87c6dbf32-2
00:41:28.726 --> 00:41:37.035
strategies would be, I don't
know, represented to the

12d20087-3150-48b7-bac5-d4e87c6dbf32-3
00:41:37.035 --> 00:41:38.420
customer.

3bd01051-78f5-4db5-a022-06fa1f4999fe-0
00:41:43.670 --> 00:42:04.526
Yep, yeah, I'll show it. I like
the word contains here, but

3bd01051-78f5-4db5-a022-06fa1f4999fe-1
00:42:04.526 --> 00:42:09.740
okay. And then.

c425296f-46fd-4bbd-bb2e-bfc53a9a07dc-0
00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:21.960
Would that turn into or or the
user could set up an alert? Is

c425296f-46fd-4bbd-bb2e-bfc53a9a07dc-1
00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:28.992
that that's probably independent
of the first strategy, right?

c425296f-46fd-4bbd-bb2e-bfc53a9a07dc-2
00:42:28.992 --> 00:42:35.801
You broke up there, Mike. So
when a user sets up an alert, a

c425296f-46fd-4bbd-bb2e-bfc53a9a07dc-3
00:42:35.801 --> 00:42:38.480
trader sets up an alert.

c54730c4-a47e-4cc5-a903-ffbcfb962e08-0
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:48.788
Does that relate to the proposed
strategy or is that just relate

c54730c4-a47e-4cc5-a903-ffbcfb962e08-1
00:42:48.788 --> 00:42:54.404
to the volatility of what they
selected in the original

c54730c4-a47e-4cc5-a903-ffbcfb962e08-2
00:42:54.404 --> 00:43:00.221
question? And I would like to
see if they put in an alert

c54730c4-a47e-4cc5-a903-ffbcfb962e08-3
00:43:00.221 --> 00:43:06.739
based off like the price of the
strategy, they could, they could

c54730c4-a47e-4cc5-a903-ffbcfb962e08-4
00:43:06.739 --> 00:43:10.349
you know enable that as well,
okay.

835076bb-2de5-477d-82a1-4eb9634d4a4e-0
00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:15.884
Like, I didn't care. Not
everyone thinks things in terms

835076bb-2de5-477d-82a1-4eb9634d4a4e-1
00:43:15.884 --> 00:43:20.150
of vulnerability, a lot of thing
in terms of rights. I think they

835076bb-2de5-477d-82a1-4eb9634d4a4e-2
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:23.705
could be independent though.
Like just because you are

835076bb-2de5-477d-82a1-4eb9634d4a4e-3
00:43:23.705 --> 00:43:27.778
interested in a alert when ball
changes a certain amount, that

835076bb-2de5-477d-82a1-4eb9634d4a4e-4
00:43:27.778 --> 00:43:31.915
doesn't necessarily mean you're
interested in doing a straddle,

835076bb-2de5-477d-82a1-4eb9634d4a4e-5
00:43:31.915 --> 00:43:35.793
OK? You may just want to know
when something interesting is

835076bb-2de5-477d-82a1-4eb9634d4a4e-6
00:43:35.793 --> 00:43:36.440
happening.

0e4c864b-95e4-4bc1-afa5-5ba3166c8aa7-0
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:29.542
With the proposed strategies
also have some like default

0e4c864b-95e4-4bc1-afa5-5ba3166c8aa7-1
00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:36.534
alerts. Mike that's a year
question. I don't know how to

0e4c864b-95e4-4bc1-afa5-5ba3166c8aa7-2
00:44:36.534 --> 00:44:44.140
answer that one. Yeah I would
say like it's based off of ever

0e4c864b-95e4-4bc1-afa5-5ba3166c8aa7-3
00:44:44.140 --> 00:44:51.745
level the. So there would be
like a tech field that would say

0e4c864b-95e4-4bc1-afa5-5ba3166c8aa7-4
00:44:51.745 --> 00:44:52.850
you know.

3d880d8b-7f07-4365-95a0-b5a4f393018a-0
00:44:53.170 --> 00:44:59.177
Alert me at this level and
whenever it gets to that side

3d880d8b-7f07-4365-95a0-b5a4f393018a-1
00:44:59.177 --> 00:45:05.184
one way or the other, you get
the alert. So Mike, do you

3d880d8b-7f07-4365-95a0-b5a4f393018a-2
00:45:05.184 --> 00:45:11.824
envision having alerts on like
the price of various strategies

3d880d8b-7f07-4365-95a0-b5a4f393018a-3
00:45:11.824 --> 00:45:18.042
as well or just the, Yep, the
yes. So that would almost be

3d880d8b-7f07-4365-95a0-b5a4f393018a-4
00:45:18.042 --> 00:45:24.260
another category of alert.
There's sort of an alert on the

3d880d8b-7f07-4365-95a0-b5a4f393018a-5
00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.789
Vol underlying and skew.

6b48e6c3-3ea9-4563-9f70-7df92724a229-0
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:38.103
And then there's also alerts on
strategy prices, correct. And

6b48e6c3-3ea9-4563-9f70-7df92724a229-1
00:45:38.103 --> 00:45:48.748
then if the trader wanted to add
another alert, they could still

6b48e6c3-3ea9-4563-9f70-7df92724a229-2
00:45:48.748 --> 00:45:57.100
go ahead and do that. Yeah.
Yeah. Okay. All right.

672fcaa9-df2a-45cb-b383-a36310e7300a-0
00:46:09.730 --> 00:46:16.112
I'm wondering about moving
proposed strategies that were

672fcaa9-df2a-45cb-b383-a36310e7300a-1
00:46:16.112 --> 00:46:23.054
towards marketing, because the
proposed strategy depends upon

672fcaa9-df2a-45cb-b383-a36310e7300a-2
00:46:23.054 --> 00:46:29.995
the market opinion, right? Kind
of like a a proposed strategy

672fcaa9-df2a-45cb-b383-a36310e7300a-3
00:46:29.995 --> 00:46:36.490
sort of exists independently of
a market opinion in that.

70866026-5d03-4db6-ac79-700948c235d7-0
00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:44.611
Like the price of a straddle
exists whether you care about it

70866026-5d03-4db6-ac79-700948c235d7-1
00:46:44.611 --> 00:46:51.229
or not. And now whether we like
actually compute that value, you

70866026-5d03-4db6-ac79-700948c235d7-2
00:46:51.229 --> 00:46:56.828
know that's kind of an
implementation detail. Maybe we

70866026-5d03-4db6-ac79-700948c235d7-3
00:46:56.828 --> 00:47:02.732
compute all of the strategy
price prices, maybe we don't,

70866026-5d03-4db6-ac79-700948c235d7-4
00:47:02.732 --> 00:47:03.140
but.

a210c3e5-a2f1-4059-8a11-b5b3c78e90fa-0
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:13.704
You don't really need to have a
market opinion to create a

a210c3e5-a2f1-4059-8a11-b5b3c78e90fa-1
00:47:13.704 --> 00:47:20.939
strategy. Yeah, it's a little
bit like your strategies and

a210c3e5-a2f1-4059-8a11-b5b3c78e90fa-2
00:47:20.939 --> 00:47:28.541
then your proposed strategies.
But that last one, Kevin Scott

a210c3e5-a2f1-4059-8a11-b5b3c78e90fa-3
00:47:28.541 --> 00:47:36.266
just said you don't have to have
a market opinion to propose a

a210c3e5-a2f1-4059-8a11-b5b3c78e90fa-4
00:47:36.266 --> 00:47:37.370
strategy.

0938818f-20ba-40e9-b75e-a3e167fe7d26-0
00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:44.212
No, I think, I think Kevin now
that actually the A strategy say

0938818f-20ba-40e9-b75e-a3e167fe7d26-1
00:47:44.212 --> 00:47:50.102
a straddle exists whether you
have an opinion or not if the

0938818f-20ba-40e9-b75e-a3e167fe7d26-2
00:47:50.102 --> 00:47:56.483
and then a market opinion tells
you which of the strategies is a

0938818f-20ba-40e9-b75e-a3e167fe7d26-3
00:47:56.483 --> 00:47:58.250
proposed strategy.

11154925-0dfa-4e61-b3e3-ed4f531aafae-0
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:34.065
I don't quite know how to
describe that yet. All these

11154925-0dfa-4e61-b3e3-ed4f531aafae-1
00:48:34.065 --> 00:48:42.444
generic letters things I'll say
in forms. Yeah, I think if you

11154925-0dfa-4e61-b3e3-ed4f531aafae-2
00:48:42.444 --> 00:48:43.110
take.

7f725e07-8996-4609-9bf7-bf0d897fcf80-0
00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:54.645
A proposed strategy is a subset
of all the strategies that are

7f725e07-8996-4609-9bf7-bf0d897fcf80-1
00:48:54.645 --> 00:48:59.140
congruent with your market
opinion.

2b6b27c7-76f1-4d2f-b7bf-1677a154b8e3-0
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:21.358
That's probably more like hot
trades is essentially a list of

2b6b27c7-76f1-4d2f-b7bf-1677a154b8e3-1
00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:22.190
strategies.

ab892b4c-63f8-499d-a48c-4ddf55ac8bc1-0
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:10.083
I mean a little trouble
decoupling like like the core

ab892b4c-63f8-499d-a48c-4ddf55ac8bc1-1
00:50:10.083 --> 00:50:16.221
entity relationship from the
implementation. In my mind I

ab892b4c-63f8-499d-a48c-4ddf55ac8bc1-2
00:50:16.221 --> 00:50:22.887
know like do you have a separate
list of market opinions or is

ab892b4c-63f8-499d-a48c-4ddf55ac8bc1-3
00:50:22.887 --> 00:50:25.850
and are is there a separate?

2b72e31d-d5c3-4c6a-8728-5e5c7e9e54c2-0
00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:31.442
Way of adding strategies to your
hot trades list. Other than

2b72e31d-d5c3-4c6a-8728-5e5c7e9e54c2-1
00:50:31.442 --> 00:50:35.432
opinions I guess. I don't know.
I guess. Well, the way I would

2b72e31d-d5c3-4c6a-8728-5e5c7e9e54c2-2
00:50:35.432 --> 00:50:39.485
think about it, and maybe this
is to implementation coupled, is

2b72e31d-d5c3-4c6a-8728-5e5c7e9e54c2-3
00:50:39.485 --> 00:50:43.221
like your hot trades list
contains strategies. They can be

2b72e31d-d5c3-4c6a-8728-5e5c7e9e54c2-4
00:50:43.221 --> 00:50:47.274
any strategy whether you think
it's a good one or not. But then

2b72e31d-d5c3-4c6a-8728-5e5c7e9e54c2-5
00:50:47.274 --> 00:50:51.390
there's also some way of saying
this is my opinion. Suggest me a

2b72e31d-d5c3-4c6a-8728-5e5c7e9e54c2-6
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:55.380
strategy if I'm interested in
that strategy. Add it to the hot

2b72e31d-d5c3-4c6a-8728-5e5c7e9e54c2-7
00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:56.140
trades list.

3dadbf8a-0374-477d-8b20-8d94c61337cb-0
00:51:01.940 --> 00:51:06.700
Does that sound right, Mike?
Yeah, the second thing that you

3dadbf8a-0374-477d-8b20-8d94c61337cb-1
00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:11.616
said was the right thing. OK. So
did you think of those as two

3dadbf8a-0374-477d-8b20-8d94c61337cb-2
00:51:11.616 --> 00:51:16.298
different options? Because I
thought of them as part of the

3dadbf8a-0374-477d-8b20-8d94c61337cb-3
00:51:16.298 --> 00:51:20.980
same, same way you would have an
opinion, it would generate

3dadbf8a-0374-477d-8b20-8d94c61337cb-4
00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:25.505
strategies and then you could
click on whether or not you

3dadbf8a-0374-477d-8b20-8d94c61337cb-5
00:51:25.505 --> 00:51:29.953
wanted to or whether that
strategy fit your opinion that

3dadbf8a-0374-477d-8b20-8d94c61337cb-6
00:51:29.953 --> 00:51:30.500
that's.

dcb6c770-428f-4c2a-8c83-eb6616bf5b18-0
00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:35.669
I'm repeating what you're
saying. Is that correct? Kind of

dcb6c770-428f-4c2a-8c83-eb6616bf5b18-1
00:51:35.669 --> 00:51:40.729
the way I was envisioning it is
that sort of the hot trades is

dcb6c770-428f-4c2a-8c83-eb6616bf5b18-2
00:51:40.729 --> 00:51:45.870
just a list of strategies that
you want to keep track of, maybe

dcb6c770-428f-4c2a-8c83-eb6616bf5b18-3
00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:50.770
generate alerts off of. And then
there's some sort of market

dcb6c770-428f-4c2a-8c83-eb6616bf5b18-4
00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:55.992
opinion tool which helps you add
strategies to hot trades if you

dcb6c770-428f-4c2a-8c83-eb6616bf5b18-5
00:51:55.992 --> 00:52:00.410
don't know what you want to put
there by yourself, so.

a83baba3-0561-4a3e-bfb7-712d599d8278-0
00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:05.251
Let me let me restate that
Scott, in that it's almost like

a83baba3-0561-4a3e-bfb7-712d599d8278-1
00:52:05.251 --> 00:52:09.918
you present a list of of of all
strategies, at least ones that

a83baba3-0561-4a3e-bfb7-712d599d8278-2
00:52:09.918 --> 00:52:14.290
are applicable, but the ones
that are recommended float to

a83baba3-0561-4a3e-bfb7-712d599d8278-3
00:52:14.290 --> 00:52:18.957
the top. You know it's it's kind
of like when you're searching

a83baba3-0561-4a3e-bfb7-712d599d8278-4
00:52:18.957 --> 00:52:23.551
for stuff on Amazon you'll get
some Amazon recommended but we

a83baba3-0561-4a3e-bfb7-712d599d8278-5
00:52:23.551 --> 00:52:28.367
also show a whole bunch of crap
if you want it not quite so like

a83baba3-0561-4a3e-bfb7-712d599d8278-6
00:52:28.367 --> 00:52:28.960
the the.

30489253-e9c0-47f7-9c69-9e1e75922074-0
00:52:29.630 --> 00:52:36.295
The total universe of strategies
is much larger than could fit on

30489253-e9c0-47f7-9c69-9e1e75922074-1
00:52:36.295 --> 00:52:42.456
a single tool. So like we've
kind of been talking about like

30489253-e9c0-47f7-9c69-9e1e75922074-2
00:52:42.456 --> 00:52:47.909
a fairly basic set of
strategies, but even that would

30489253-e9c0-47f7-9c69-9e1e75922074-3
00:52:47.909 --> 00:52:53.969
be like what was it? I think 3
to the third power, which is

30489253-e9c0-47f7-9c69-9e1e75922074-4
00:52:53.969 --> 00:52:58.110
what, 27? So 27 possible
strategies per.

58386f07-61a2-462e-b580-bfab16763427-0
00:52:59.730 --> 00:53:04.911
Expiration, the expiration is
going to be like at least, well

58386f07-61a2-462e-b580-bfab16763427-1
00:53:04.911 --> 00:53:09.926
right now I think it's in the
neighborhood of a hundred 120

58386f07-61a2-462e-b580-bfab16763427-2
00:53:09.926 --> 00:53:15.275
different expirations. So we're
not going to throw up a list of

58386f07-61a2-462e-b580-bfab16763427-3
00:53:15.275 --> 00:53:20.040
2700 different strategies into
people's hot trades list.

58386f07-61a2-462e-b580-bfab16763427-4
00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:25.472
They're going to want to have a
more focused list than that. But

58386f07-61a2-462e-b580-bfab16763427-5
00:53:25.472 --> 00:53:26.810
so like one way.

96292ac7-9255-48f9-b602-ed950cafbc25-0
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:32.050
That something might end up in
my hot trades list is I just

96292ac7-9255-48f9-b602-ed950cafbc25-1
00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:36.253
know about it and I'm interested
in it. So say I'm like mostly an

96292ac7-9255-48f9-b602-ed950cafbc25-2
00:53:36.253 --> 00:53:39.883
underlying trader but I know
what a straddle is. I don't

96292ac7-9255-48f9-b602-ed950cafbc25-3
00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:43.704
really have an opinion on on
whether the straddle is fairly

96292ac7-9255-48f9-b602-ed950cafbc25-4
00:53:43.704 --> 00:53:47.588
priced or not, but it's just
sort of a a useful thing for me

96292ac7-9255-48f9-b602-ed950cafbc25-5
00:53:47.588 --> 00:53:51.345
to know for risk management
purposes basically. So I put a

96292ac7-9255-48f9-b602-ed950cafbc25-6
00:53:51.345 --> 00:53:55.230
straddle into my hot trades list
and but how was it do that?

8060974a-ec9d-4fc8-9cea-c6c8f5f72b19-0
00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:02.784
How would how would they, how
would they find that straddle

8060974a-ec9d-4fc8-9cea-c6c8f5f72b19-1
00:54:02.784 --> 00:54:10.246
like in like how would they work
with the interface to add it? Or

8060974a-ec9d-4fc8-9cea-c6c8f5f72b19-2
00:54:10.246 --> 00:54:17.031
how would they know that the
straddle exists? And the first

8060974a-ec9d-4fc8-9cea-c6c8f5f72b19-3
00:54:17.031 --> 00:54:23.702
how how would they work with the
interface to add it? Yeah

8060974a-ec9d-4fc8-9cea-c6c8f5f72b19-4
00:54:23.702 --> 00:54:24.720
probably.

d397bfae-6b71-49db-8302-5623d738122f-0
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:41.199
A dialogue box, pick your
expiration, then pick your your

d397bfae-6b71-49db-8302-5623d738122f-1
00:54:41.199 --> 00:54:50.359
strategy. So you would input. I
mean, they'd still get to the

d397bfae-6b71-49db-8302-5623d738122f-2
00:54:50.359 --> 00:54:58.632
couple 100, they'd still get
that list of a couple 100,

d397bfae-6b71-49db-8302-5623d738122f-3
00:54:58.632 --> 00:55:00.110
right? No.

9cb4c007-08ac-4a5a-b24e-35d9ce0e1585-0
00:55:00.410 --> 00:55:05.564
So like the the first step of
that is pick an expiration. The

9cb4c007-08ac-4a5a-b24e-35d9ce0e1585-1
00:55:05.564 --> 00:55:10.718
way you pick an expiration is
you pick an exchange, a product

9cb4c007-08ac-4a5a-b24e-35d9ce0e1585-2
00:55:10.718 --> 00:55:16.038
code and a contract date through
whatever kind of interface you

9cb4c007-08ac-4a5a-b24e-35d9ce0e1585-3
00:55:16.038 --> 00:55:20.860
want to build around that. So
pick up, pick an expiration

9cb4c007-08ac-4a5a-b24e-35d9ce0e1585-4
00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:26.097
first, then the second step is
pick a strategy. There are 2027

9cb4c007-08ac-4a5a-b24e-35d9ce0e1585-5
00:55:26.097 --> 00:55:28.010
strategies in our list.

130754d9-6c2c-4ce3-9f44-70757c284c12-0
00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:35.195
So you could just have that as a
complete list there. I guess

130754d9-6c2c-4ce3-9f44-70757c284c12-1
00:55:35.195 --> 00:55:40.218
maybe you skip it all and just
if you want to add a trade, your

130754d9-6c2c-4ce3-9f44-70757c284c12-2
00:55:40.218 --> 00:55:45.163
hot trade list, you just do the
like you sort of have to do it

130754d9-6c2c-4ce3-9f44-70757c284c12-3
00:55:45.163 --> 00:55:50.107
backwards. If you know you want
a straddle then tell it you're

130754d9-6c2c-4ce3-9f44-70757c284c12-4
00:55:50.107 --> 00:55:54.581
bullish on volatility and know
that that'll give you a a

130754d9-6c2c-4ce3-9f44-70757c284c12-5
00:55:54.581 --> 00:55:59.289
straddle. But it kind of seems
like maybe we would want to.

5fb6f8a6-1a35-46ba-ab92-7ac9b9ebd809-0
00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:04.436
Not link those two as hard. So
what I think I'm hearing is

5fb6f8a6-1a35-46ba-ab92-7ac9b9ebd809-1
00:56:04.436 --> 00:56:08.286
that, like, really, I think
you're gonna be, you're gonna

5fb6f8a6-1a35-46ba-ab92-7ac9b9ebd809-2
00:56:08.286 --> 00:56:12.534
have a strategy, whether that's
a proposed strategy or not. You

5fb6f8a6-1a35-46ba-ab92-7ac9b9ebd809-3
00:56:12.534 --> 00:56:15.920
kind of like as a UI, you don't
really care. Yeah.

3f622126-a396-4d26-99ce-d8a31009f680-0
00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:43.416
And then like sort of as you go
going down the line, there's

3f622126-a396-4d26-99ce-d8a31009f680-1
00:56:43.416 --> 00:56:47.851
like an even more infinite list
of strategies. Like probably in

3f622126-a396-4d26-99ce-d8a31009f680-2
00:56:47.851 --> 00:56:52.078
at the time being because of the
way we're doing market data

3f622126-a396-4d26-99ce-d8a31009f680-3
00:56:52.078 --> 00:56:55.958
right now, there's going to be a
pretty limited list of

3f622126-a396-4d26-99ce-d8a31009f680-4
00:56:55.958 --> 00:56:59.908
strategies. But in full
generality, a strategy is just a

3f622126-a396-4d26-99ce-d8a31009f680-5
00:56:59.908 --> 00:57:01.710
collection of instruments.

ea69d472-a135-49a3-b42e-80522f5f0616-0
00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:09.973
And you can compute things like
the current price on them. And

ea69d472-a135-49a3-b42e-80522f5f0616-1
00:57:09.973 --> 00:57:14.848
so, you know, however many
instruments there are in the

ea69d472-a135-49a3-b42e-80522f5f0616-2
00:57:14.848 --> 00:57:20.070
future, you know, there's, you
know, an infinite variety of

ea69d472-a135-49a3-b42e-80522f5f0616-3
00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:25.119
strategies, just, you know,
combine them up, combining up

ea69d472-a135-49a3-b42e-80522f5f0616-4
00:57:25.119 --> 00:57:30.690
sets of instruments whatever way
you want. But we don't have a.

0bd219ad-bef0-4e6f-998d-3225310506ea-0
00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:38.111
Good enough market data source
right now to support that. So

0bd219ad-bef0-4e6f-998d-3225310506ea-1
00:57:38.111 --> 00:57:43.419
we're gonna constrain the list
of strategies so that we don't

0bd219ad-bef0-4e6f-998d-3225310506ea-2
00:57:43.419 --> 00:57:48.470
have to handle market data on
any single instrument on or,

0bd219ad-bef0-4e6f-998d-3225310506ea-3
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:52.579
sorry, on every single
instrument in the in the

0bd219ad-bef0-4e6f-998d-3225310506ea-4
00:57:52.579 --> 00:57:57.373
universe at the same time,
right? All right. Let me ask

0bd219ad-bef0-4e6f-998d-3225310506ea-5
00:57:57.373 --> 00:57:59.770
easier questions. A traitor.

e6f387ab-218b-4e2a-95a3-f2e370b16a2a-0
00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:06.060
And they set these things up
that belongs to that particular

e6f387ab-218b-4e2a-95a3-f2e370b16a2a-1
00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:12.530
person, right? It doesn't belong
to a desk or anything like that.

e6f387ab-218b-4e2a-95a3-f2e370b16a2a-2
00:58:12.530 --> 00:58:18.511
It belongs to a person. Correct.
Okay. And these will all be

e6f387ab-218b-4e2a-95a3-f2e370b16a2a-3
00:58:18.511 --> 00:58:24.589
emailed to them. Or we have like
in app alerts. Yeah, e-mail,

e6f387ab-218b-4e2a-95a3-f2e370b16a2a-4
00:58:24.589 --> 00:58:25.080
okay.

563c6673-98b3-476b-b462-f470c1a4c4b2-0
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:38.031
Will we set up some sort of
alert preferences like Alert me

563c6673-98b3-476b-b462-f470c1a4c4b2-1
00:58:38.031 --> 00:58:47.508
right away or consolidated end
of day or things like that be

563c6673-98b3-476b-b462-f470c1a4c4b2-2
00:58:47.508 --> 00:58:50.149
alert right away?

2791354c-1c68-4f45-a2b6-22038374be48-0
00:58:59.170 --> 00:59:08.655
No, no text alerts right? Text.
Yeah. No no text alerts. No no

2791354c-1c68-4f45-a2b6-22038374be48-1
00:59:08.655 --> 00:59:10.010
no no no.

8ac12b33-d3ab-4983-be54-91ed7886bcd4-0
00:59:26.850 --> 00:59:33.787
So there's not really any sort
of preferences in terms of

8ac12b33-d3ab-4983-be54-91ed7886bcd4-1
00:59:33.787 --> 00:59:40.484
alerts like overarching
preferences. I'm just trying to

8ac12b33-d3ab-4983-be54-91ed7886bcd4-2
00:59:40.484 --> 00:59:47.661
think of like Scott like this.
If I'm assuming if users are

8ac12b33-d3ab-4983-be54-91ed7886bcd4-3
00:59:47.661 --> 00:59:55.196
entering their own phone for a
text alert they might put their

8ac12b33-d3ab-4983-be54-91ed7886bcd4-4
00:59:55.196 --> 01:00:01.893
like personal cell phone and I
don't not sure how their

8ac12b33-d3ab-4983-be54-91ed7886bcd4-5
01:00:01.893 --> 01:00:06.080
employers are going to feel
about.

c2b0a572-f95a-4d35-b052-29eae86f2946-0
01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.978
There's just like like the that
this communication would be seen

c2b0a572-f95a-4d35-b052-29eae86f2946-1
01:00:10.978 --> 01:00:15.318
as like solicitation to trade
and so it all kind of has to be.

c2b0a572-f95a-4d35-b052-29eae86f2946-2
01:00:15.318 --> 01:00:19.727
I'm just trying to avoid these
like pitfalls. So I think e-mail

c2b0a572-f95a-4d35-b052-29eae86f2946-3
01:00:19.727 --> 01:00:23.930
the company e-mail would be
best. So I'm not sure if you are

c2b0a572-f95a-4d35-b052-29eae86f2946-4
01:00:23.930 --> 01:00:28.339
gonna put their personal emails
into the as like a username for

c2b0a572-f95a-4d35-b052-29eae86f2946-5
01:00:28.339 --> 01:00:32.748
a login. Yeah I would. I would
sort of agree with you there and

c2b0a572-f95a-4d35-b052-29eae86f2946-6
01:00:32.748 --> 01:00:34.540
I don't think there's the.

6982059e-aa41-4d28-b8a1-e5536f599ab0-0
01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:40.132
Like a strong need to have the
the text alerts, you know, I

6982059e-aa41-4d28-b8a1-e5536f599ab0-1
01:00:40.132 --> 01:00:44.467
think probably most people have
their e-mail up and we'll see an

6982059e-aa41-4d28-b8a1-e5536f599ab0-2
01:00:44.467 --> 01:00:48.803
e-mail right away. We could add.
And then a way to mitigate that

6982059e-aa41-4d28-b8a1-e5536f599ab0-3
01:00:48.803 --> 01:00:52.671
would be to add like an in app
alert if they want to keep

6982059e-aa41-4d28-b8a1-e5536f599ab0-4
01:00:52.671 --> 01:00:56.874
their, you know, the web page up
all the time or actually, you

6982059e-aa41-4d28-b8a1-e5536f599ab0-5
01:00:56.874 --> 01:01:01.276
know, I actually don't know very
much about in app alerts for web

6982059e-aa41-4d28-b8a1-e5536f599ab0-6
01:01:01.276 --> 01:01:02.009
stuff, but.

985fe971-c907-47d7-acce-4f4202849174-0
01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:06.487
I could could that solve the
problem of like having a harder

985fe971-c907-47d7-acce-4f4202849174-1
01:01:06.487 --> 01:01:10.575
to ignore alert than an e-mail?
I don't know how many guys are

985fe971-c907-47d7-acce-4f4202849174-2
01:01:10.575 --> 01:01:14.662
going to have our web page up
all day. Maybe they will. I mean

985fe971-c907-47d7-acce-4f4202849174-3
01:01:14.662 --> 01:01:18.555
it's matching success. They
would if it's not and they just

985fe971-c907-47d7-acce-4f4202849174-4
01:01:18.555 --> 01:01:22.707
see the alert like that might be
fine too. Yeah. Do you have to

985fe971-c907-47d7-acce-4f4202849174-5
01:01:22.707 --> 01:01:26.794
have the web page open to have
an alert guys there is a method

985fe971-c907-47d7-acce-4f4202849174-6
01:01:26.794 --> 01:01:30.947
to actually push notifications
browser. You have to do a little

985fe971-c907-47d7-acce-4f4202849174-7
01:01:30.947 --> 01:01:32.050
research into it.

229e3595-f057-4214-b6b5-cb2f42776840-0
01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:37.362
We we haven't done it before,
but there is a way to do that. I

229e3595-f057-4214-b6b5-cb2f42776840-1
01:01:37.362 --> 01:01:41.820
was thinking a little more
pedestrian in when you log in,

229e3595-f057-4214-b6b5-cb2f42776840-2
01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:46.586
you can see your most recent
alerts, which at least in theory

229e3595-f057-4214-b6b5-cb2f42776840-3
01:01:46.586 --> 01:01:51.428
could be the same sort of thing
with the trade confirm, right?

229e3595-f057-4214-b6b5-cb2f42776840-4
01:01:51.428 --> 01:01:55.963
You could log in and see your
trade confirms. It's kind of

229e3595-f057-4214-b6b5-cb2f42776840-5
01:01:55.963 --> 01:02:00.729
like your your doc center or
your alert center. Yeah, I think

229e3595-f057-4214-b6b5-cb2f42776840-6
01:02:00.729 --> 01:02:00.960
my.

7213cf0e-cb8e-4641-ab48-c859c605e99f-0
01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:06.301
My lien would be to start with
just e-mail alerts and nothing

7213cf0e-cb8e-4641-ab48-c859c605e99f-1
01:02:06.301 --> 01:02:10.779
else. And if we added other
stuff later, whether it's like a

7213cf0e-cb8e-4641-ab48-c859c605e99f-2
01:02:10.779 --> 01:02:14.890
message center in the app or an
alert system or text or

7213cf0e-cb8e-4641-ab48-c859c605e99f-3
01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:19.441
whatever, you know, we can, we
should probably figure out the

7213cf0e-cb8e-4641-ab48-c859c605e99f-4
01:02:19.441 --> 01:02:23.698
details of that based on
customers feedback after we have

7213cf0e-cb8e-4641-ab48-c859c605e99f-5
01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:28.030
like the, you know, the minimal
working alert thing going.

405229c7-e705-46bf-9e5b-85cdb7058ffd-0
01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:42.199
Okay, this is pretty good. Hey
Kevin, you're you're sticking

405229c7-e705-46bf-9e5b-85cdb7058ffd-1
01:02:42.199 --> 01:02:48.486
out for hot trades, can you, I
think you mean Trader there

405229c7-e705-46bf-9e5b-85cdb7058ffd-2
01:02:48.486 --> 01:02:54.773
instead of trade, right? I was
looking back at it and got,

405229c7-e705-46bf-9e5b-85cdb7058ffd-3
01:02:54.773 --> 01:03:01.060
yeah, financial products the
trader is most interested in.

489d2cb6-0867-4791-93dd-147738821f35-0
01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:16.911
Should I say in which not DAG,
my car was full there. Yeah, so

489d2cb6-0867-4791-93dd-147738821f35-1
01:03:16.911 --> 01:03:27.591
it's not a mouse. How do you
spell that anyway? Home does not

489d2cb6-0867-4791-93dd-147738821f35-2
01:03:27.591 --> 01:03:33.620
do what I want to do. Acts
Finder.

2c202bfd-f3f0-4bd6-9802-136691182e89-0
01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:41.793
I think we're good for X Finder
right now. Anything else y'all

2c202bfd-f3f0-4bd6-9802-136691182e89-1
01:03:41.793 --> 01:03:48.978
can think of that you want us to
do, I would maybe readdress the

2c202bfd-f3f0-4bd6-9802-136691182e89-2
01:03:48.978 --> 01:03:56.052
financial instrument aspect of
it. Yeah, maybe all we have is a

2c202bfd-f3f0-4bd6-9802-136691182e89-3
01:03:56.052 --> 01:03:59.590
little relates there relates to.

822e56ea-59f9-44a6-958b-b9b7a2d9213b-0
01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:05.777
It's really like a strategy as a
collection of financial

822e56ea-59f9-44a6-958b-b9b7a2d9213b-1
01:04:05.777 --> 01:04:10.954
instruments. That's kind of what
it actually is, although it

822e56ea-59f9-44a6-958b-b9b7a2d9213b-2
01:04:10.954 --> 01:04:15.792
might also be a collection of
financial instruments that

822e56ea-59f9-44a6-958b-b9b7a2d9213b-3
01:04:15.792 --> 01:04:20.884
changes over time according to
certain rules. It's like the

822e56ea-59f9-44a6-958b-b9b7a2d9213b-4
01:04:20.884 --> 01:04:25.976
example of that would be a
strategy is a strategical and at

822e56ea-59f9-44a6-958b-b9b7a2d9213b-5
01:04:25.976 --> 01:04:30.220
the money call and put as the
underlying changes.

f3d217b5-3541-4b70-9e4b-c8d62baf46ed-0
01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:37.652
The exact instruments that make
up the at the money straddle

f3d217b5-3541-4b70-9e4b-c8d62baf46ed-1
01:04:37.652 --> 01:04:43.950
change as well. So you can kind
of think about it really out of

f3d217b5-3541-4b70-9e4b-c8d62baf46ed-2
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:50.248
their way. You could have like
floating strategies or you could

f3d217b5-3541-4b70-9e4b-c8d62baf46ed-3
01:04:50.248 --> 01:04:55.758
have like sort of fixed
strategies. So are you thinking

f3d217b5-3541-4b70-9e4b-c8d62baf46ed-4
01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:59.990
of like connecting this up to
there? Yeah.

2217dacc-09b5-4b08-abdb-67368e5aaa82-0
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.040
And possibly building the
relates to a from hot trades

2217dacc-09b5-4b08-abdb-67368e5aaa82-1
01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:18.263
because it or at least it
relates to many, well, I think

2217dacc-09b5-4b08-abdb-67368e5aaa82-2
01:05:18.263 --> 01:05:24.220
when they come in they're going
to look at a listing of you know

2217dacc-09b5-4b08-abdb-67368e5aaa82-3
01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:30.084
products and this goes back to
hierarchy we had up up top right

2217dacc-09b5-4b08-abdb-67368e5aaa82-4
01:05:30.084 --> 01:05:35.400
that they're going to say I want
October 22 corn options.

72b93d14-6f25-40e8-b341-ea2a9008b85b-0
01:05:40.610 --> 01:05:46.644
Yeah. So that's not, that's not
a financial instrument though,

72b93d14-6f25-40e8-b341-ea2a9008b85b-1
01:05:46.644 --> 01:05:52.870
that's an expiration. Yeah, I'm,
I'm, I'm agreeing with you. I'm

72b93d14-6f25-40e8-b341-ea2a9008b85b-2
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:58.904
wondering if you want to spend
all the time on that. Right now

72b93d14-6f25-40e8-b341-ea2a9008b85b-3
01:05:58.904 --> 01:06:04.651
it's kind of like this, right?
I, I basically have too many

72b93d14-6f25-40e8-b341-ea2a9008b85b-4
01:06:04.651 --> 01:06:10.111
questions. I would probably
spend like a couple hours on

72b93d14-6f25-40e8-b341-ea2a9008b85b-5
01:06:10.111 --> 01:06:10.590
this.

d0a9e9a0-740d-426f-9df0-939ff5f78005-0
01:06:13.150 --> 01:06:21.869
But let's see. So it's kind of
like, should we call it, we

d0a9e9a0-740d-426f-9df0-939ff5f78005-1
01:06:21.869 --> 01:06:28.667
somewhere call it back
expirations or product

d0a9e9a0-740d-426f-9df0-939ff5f78005-2
01:06:28.667 --> 01:06:37.091
expirations? Expirations is
usually what I call it. Yep,

d0a9e9a0-740d-426f-9df0-939ff5f78005-3
01:06:37.091 --> 01:06:41.230
format painter, no, nothing.

4d8f24ad-957a-4eb7-81b2-0b00784d26e5-0
01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:22.150
And then strategies. Yeah, yeah,
I see that. I see your second.

5aa14183-1db4-4da5-8f30-209b82199ae5-0
01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:40.258
Yeah, this is actually pretty
good. We don't usually get this

5aa14183-1db4-4da5-8f30-209b82199ae5-1
01:07:40.258 --> 01:07:46.833
in depth with a lot of our
clients because a lot of the

5aa14183-1db4-4da5-8f30-209b82199ae5-2
01:07:46.833 --> 01:07:54.112
times that the domain modeling
was lost a little bit on them,

5aa14183-1db4-4da5-8f30-209b82199ae5-3
01:07:54.112 --> 01:08:01.743
the nuances of it. OK. So we got
another product. You know what,

5aa14183-1db4-4da5-8f30-209b82199ae5-4
01:08:01.743 --> 01:08:05.500
I'm going to request a 2 minute.

4d9d252c-3a19-4680-8c54-65bbb31bf40d-0
01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:11.943
Biobreak, that's right. You
guys, for the next product, we

4d9d252c-3a19-4680-8c54-65bbb31bf40d-1
01:08:11.943 --> 01:08:17.348
can think what prior to want to
do next. Margin Optimizer, risk

4d9d252c-3a19-4680-8c54-65bbb31bf40d-2
01:08:17.348 --> 01:08:22.500
manager, VPM, we're not going to
do VPM right now, but think

4d9d252c-3a19-4680-8c54-65bbb31bf40d-3
01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:27.736
about optim, margin optimizer,
risk management. I'll be right

4d9d252c-3a19-4680-8c54-65bbb31bf40d-4
01:08:27.736 --> 01:08:32.297
back. 3 minutes and we'll
regroup. Couple minutes and

4d9d252c-3a19-4680-8c54-65bbb31bf40d-5
01:08:32.297 --> 01:08:34.240
we'll regroup. Awesome.

01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:39.380

e372b151-9792-4117-90c1-a068466d1e81-0
01:11:57.220 --> 01:12:03.060
I'm gonna try the video. If it
seems like that's messing up my

e372b151-9792-4117-90c1-a068466d1e81-1
01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:08.715
audio, let me know, guys. OK.
Yeah. Scott. Yep. Can you take

e372b151-9792-4117-90c1-a068466d1e81-2
01:12:08.715 --> 01:12:14.648
the lead on on explaining margin
optimizer? I guess we're gonna

e372b151-9792-4117-90c1-a068466d1e81-3
01:12:14.648 --> 01:12:20.488
go with. OK, Kevin, you're just
making it worse by opening the

e372b151-9792-4117-90c1-a068466d1e81-4
01:12:20.488 --> 01:12:24.660
Annex Coke. You realize that,
right? I know.

7c625c30-899c-4630-8881-b7232b0b789d-0
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:32.439
Hey, I'm glad it wasn't the only
one. Nope, you weren't. There's

7c625c30-899c-4630-8881-b7232b0b789d-1
01:12:32.439 --> 01:12:39.017
a lot of people in that men's
room right there. So hey guys,

7c625c30-899c-4630-8881-b7232b0b789d-2
01:12:39.017 --> 01:12:45.164
I'm sorry I got a hard stop in
about 25 minutes or so. I

7c625c30-899c-4630-8881-b7232b0b789d-3
01:12:45.164 --> 01:12:51.742
dealing with some family stuff
over here. Sure. So just adds

7c625c30-899c-4630-8881-b7232b0b789d-4
01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:55.839
up. The five pop out just got
jumped.

10f110bc-e2fd-4618-b82b-2336ffab8ba1-0
01:12:57.990 --> 01:13:03.417
We were planning to wrap up at
noon anyway, so we can just, you

10f110bc-e2fd-4618-b82b-2336ffab8ba1-1
01:13:03.417 --> 01:13:08.760
know, that's close enough. Yep.
Yep. Great. Thanks. All right.

10f110bc-e2fd-4618-b82b-2336ffab8ba1-2
01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:14.103
Customer uploads position and
receives trade structures. Okay.

10f110bc-e2fd-4618-b82b-2336ffab8ba1-3
01:13:14.103 --> 01:13:19.700
So and Andrew, we have more time
on the calendar later this week,

10f110bc-e2fd-4618-b82b-2336ffab8ba1-4
01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.990
don't we? Yes. Okay, great.

faff56bc-4f80-47c5-9bb9-2a47f4ac6db0-0
01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:38.488
So I'm gonna guess we're gonna
have a trader. Nice. Is there a

faff56bc-4f80-47c5-9bb9-2a47f4ac6db0-1
01:13:38.488 --> 01:13:43.599
hotkey to copy something? You're
on a Mac, aren't you? I I always

faff56bc-4f80-47c5-9bb9-2a47f4ac6db0-2
01:13:43.599 --> 01:13:48.556
just click on the arrow and get
get it down below it. You don't

faff56bc-4f80-47c5-9bb9-2a47f4ac6db0-3
01:13:48.556 --> 01:13:53.047
have a control C because you're
on a Mac, right? I have a

faff56bc-4f80-47c5-9bb9-2a47f4ac6db0-4
01:13:53.047 --> 01:13:56.610
control C like if I want to copy
this though.

53fd7dcc-c451-41d0-b6be-6fdb727d1957-0
01:13:57.020 --> 01:14:02.908
You normally just do a command
and drag. If you click on the

53fd7dcc-c451-41d0-b6be-6fdb727d1957-1
01:14:02.908 --> 01:14:08.700
arrow underneath, like if you
highlight Trader and click on

53fd7dcc-c451-41d0-b6be-6fdb727d1957-2
01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:14.589
the arrow underneath it, you'll
get one right underneath it.

53fd7dcc-c451-41d0-b6be-6fdb727d1957-3
01:14:14.589 --> 01:14:20.092
Yeah, then get the get the
straight lines at the. Or you

53fd7dcc-c451-41d0-b6be-6fdb727d1957-4
01:14:20.092 --> 01:14:26.077
can click and drag underneath it
and it'll give you a rounded

53fd7dcc-c451-41d0-b6be-6fdb727d1957-5
01:14:26.077 --> 01:14:26.560
line.

405e8971-c2a7-4c8d-ac76-0019fe9f29c3-0
01:14:29.750 --> 01:14:40.416
Oh, yeah, she might like better.
I do like better. You gotta give

405e8971-c2a7-4c8d-ac76-0019fe9f29c3-1
01:14:40.416 --> 01:14:49.789
it the old. Give it the English.
All right. So gotta have

405e8971-c2a7-4c8d-ac76-0019fe9f29c3-2
01:14:49.789 --> 01:14:57.870
options. We're back in. Is
everyone here? Jeremy.

4e93c135-a6af-45c5-94ff-76033b601e0a-0
01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:05.809
Hang on, let me let Jeremy so
you can hear me. Go ahead

4e93c135-a6af-45c5-94ff-76033b601e0a-1
01:15:05.809 --> 01:15:11.240
though, without him. How about
Parker? Oh, he's there.

607aa5bb-d52f-4e16-a822-f82d63cc66c2-0
01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:44.429
It's actually kind of helpful.
Oh, it's also a picture like

607aa5bb-d52f-4e16-a822-f82d63cc66c2-1
01:15:44.429 --> 01:15:50.060
this copy. There we go.

029a6cad-3256-409b-ba16-c41ec83d18f2-0
01:16:25.860 --> 01:16:36.265
Word wrap. All right, I'll deal
with that later. OK. So we've

029a6cad-3256-409b-ba16-c41ec83d18f2-1
01:16:36.265 --> 01:16:45.664
got a trader. Is that the
customer? The trader? Yep. OK

029a6cad-3256-409b-ba16-c41ec83d18f2-2
01:16:45.664 --> 01:16:49.860
and they have physicians.

3e868b25-4544-4beb-aa30-10a72825dca9-0
01:16:54.870 --> 01:17:04.112
This this will be their own
spreadsheet of positions, right?

3e868b25-4544-4beb-aa30-10a72825dca9-1
01:17:04.112 --> 01:17:12.295
It's not like these are
positions in the system, it's

3e868b25-4544-4beb-aa30-10a72825dca9-2
01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:21.234
their own, their own Excel
spreadsheet. And then are these

3e868b25-4544-4beb-aa30-10a72825dca9-3
01:17:21.234 --> 01:17:22.750
positions?

46394771-aab4-4375-b73c-d92c6437012f-0
01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:33.723
I guess it was certain template,
right? We have an Excel template

46394771-aab4-4375-b73c-d92c6437012f-1
01:17:33.723 --> 01:17:42.289
gonna be well potentially like
standardizing whatever they have

46394771-aab4-4375-b73c-d92c6437012f-2
01:17:42.289 --> 01:17:50.988
to a standard template. Yeah, my
guess would be we'll we'll want

46394771-aab4-4375-b73c-d92c6437012f-3
01:17:50.988 --> 01:17:58.350
to build different importing
like different importers.

13c7b340-d9b8-4fc3-8b4a-3b00b3598ab1-0
01:17:58.850 --> 01:18:04.855
Like, like there's a lot of,
there's a lot of firms that have

13c7b340-d9b8-4fc3-8b4a-3b00b3598ab1-1
01:18:04.855 --> 01:18:10.666
the same clearing firm, first of
all, and then a lot of the

13c7b340-d9b8-4fc3-8b4a-3b00b3598ab1-2
01:18:10.666 --> 01:18:16.090
clearing firms use the same
accounting software. So the

13c7b340-d9b8-4fc3-8b4a-3b00b3598ab1-3
01:18:16.090 --> 01:18:22.386
easiest way for the customer is
probably going to be to upload a

13c7b340-d9b8-4fc3-8b4a-3b00b3598ab1-4
01:18:22.386 --> 01:18:27.810
file that they already have. And
I think it's probably.

7959a4de-424f-4f5a-b1f8-43925cc5f208-0
01:18:29.710 --> 01:18:35.733
Somewhat doable to support at
least like the major use cases

7959a4de-424f-4f5a-b1f8-43925cc5f208-1
01:18:35.733 --> 01:18:42.152
there, so that I think would be
the best UX if it's if it's like

7959a4de-424f-4f5a-b1f8-43925cc5f208-2
01:18:42.152 --> 01:18:48.373
possible, it's just to support
whatever file they already have

7959a4de-424f-4f5a-b1f8-43925cc5f208-3
01:18:48.373 --> 01:18:54.397
and those would be like the
position files from the clearing

7959a4de-424f-4f5a-b1f8-43925cc5f208-4
01:18:54.397 --> 01:18:54.990
firms.

ce232112-27ca-441b-a5d3-0082cc3bff67-0
01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:10.931
They don't change those files
too often, do they? I mean,

ce232112-27ca-441b-a5d3-0082cc3bff67-1
01:19:10.931 --> 01:19:22.480
okay. Yeah, not data wise. Okay.
Yeah. Cool Denise, I like it.

290bacf1-e0c2-4776-8af6-c5d501a1fb0f-0
01:19:47.770 --> 01:19:51.832
And then Mike, were you were you
sort of thinking about this as a

290bacf1-e0c2-4776-8af6-c5d501a1fb0f-1
01:19:51.832 --> 01:19:55.648
fancy guess and check tool like
we we had at white Pines, are

290bacf1-e0c2-4776-8af6-c5d501a1fb0f-2
01:19:55.648 --> 01:19:59.095
you thinking of like an actual
optimizer here an actual

290bacf1-e0c2-4776-8af6-c5d501a1fb0f-3
01:19:59.095 --> 01:20:02.849
optimizer like you would you
would like I mean we just have.

443e514a-c74c-4e9d-8ac2-27710db1422f-0
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:07.666
A bunch of like precanned like
trade inputs basically or we'd

443e514a-c74c-4e9d-8ac2-27710db1422f-1
01:20:07.666 --> 01:20:11.997
start with that. That would be
like merger one of this and just

443e514a-c74c-4e9d-8ac2-27710db1422f-2
01:20:11.997 --> 01:20:16.193
like you know if you're if the
scenario is like down extreme,

443e514a-c74c-4e9d-8ac2-27710db1422f-3
01:20:16.193 --> 01:20:20.254
oh hey if you bought like X
number of puts or whatever that

443e514a-c74c-4e9d-8ac2-27710db1422f-4
01:20:20.254 --> 01:20:24.585
is how much your margin would be
reduced, OK. I'm not sure it'd

443e514a-c74c-4e9d-8ac2-27710db1422f-5
01:20:24.585 --> 01:20:28.916
be a total like solver for like
this is the optimal thing to do

443e514a-c74c-4e9d-8ac2-27710db1422f-6
01:20:28.916 --> 01:20:32.910
10 trades to get your margin
down to whatever right, yeah.

44b9c412-0038-4bf0-9e8b-f35e36d8cdbe-0
01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:41.130
Some more of a heuristic
approach than a true numerical

44b9c412-0038-4bf0-9e8b-f35e36d8cdbe-1
01:20:41.130 --> 01:20:46.762
minimization or whatever. Yeah.
I just, I think you're gonna

44b9c412-0038-4bf0-9e8b-f35e36d8cdbe-2
01:20:46.762 --> 01:20:52.487
get, I don't know, 80% of the
way there with 20% of the work.

44b9c412-0038-4bf0-9e8b-f35e36d8cdbe-3
01:20:52.487 --> 01:20:58.027
Yeah. Do you want do you want
the guessing check too? Yeah,

44b9c412-0038-4bf0-9e8b-f35e36d8cdbe-4
01:20:58.027 --> 01:20:59.320
yeah. Yep. OK.

fbc7f592-82e6-4624-9519-281910450d02-0
01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:05.481
Okay, some background info here.
Just so margins is essentially

fbc7f592-82e6-4624-9519-281910450d02-1
01:21:05.481 --> 01:21:10.641
the amount of capital that you
have to have in your account in

fbc7f592-82e6-4624-9519-281910450d02-2
01:21:10.641 --> 01:21:15.556
order for the clearing firm to
not start blowing you out of

fbc7f592-82e6-4624-9519-281910450d02-3
01:21:15.556 --> 01:21:20.880
your positions. It's also called
performance bond. You might see

fbc7f592-82e6-4624-9519-281910450d02-4
01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:25.466
that term some places, but
probably most people call it

fbc7f592-82e6-4624-9519-281910450d02-5
01:21:25.466 --> 01:21:26.040
margin.

c0e1256d-261e-45ef-8900-575811acb5bf-0
01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:37.107
Span SPAN, all caps is the CME
groups system for calculating

c0e1256d-261e-45ef-8900-575811acb5bf-1
01:21:37.107 --> 01:21:45.259
what that margin is, and it's
actually used by a number of

c0e1256d-261e-45ef-8900-575811acb5bf-2
01:21:45.259 --> 01:21:54.239
other exchanges too, but I don't
think we're going to care about

c0e1256d-261e-45ef-8900-575811acb5bf-3
01:21:54.239 --> 01:21:57.970
many of them, so maybe mjx.

1c6c0d8b-21e9-493a-9811-e7d7d0e9e1d9-0
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:08.532
So it's a bar, it's a bar
calculation. No, it's not a bar

1c6c0d8b-21e9-493a-9811-e7d7d0e9e1d9-1
01:22:08.532 --> 01:22:12.910
calculation. They like to call
it that, but it's very

1c6c0d8b-21e9-493a-9811-e7d7d0e9e1d9-2
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:18.018
different. It's it's a scenario
analysis. Basically do a bunch

1c6c0d8b-21e9-493a-9811-e7d7d0e9e1d9-3
01:22:18.018 --> 01:22:21.910
of what if scenarios choose the
biggest number.

38dbcd8f-7832-42a7-80b4-249b6d81ba62-0
01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:34.595
Say again what the the clearing
firm would do if you don't have

38dbcd8f-7832-42a7-80b4-249b6d81ba62-1
01:22:34.595 --> 01:22:39.088
enough margin? That's the amount
of capital. First they would ask

38dbcd8f-7832-42a7-80b4-249b6d81ba62-2
01:22:39.088 --> 01:22:43.443
you to send them more money, and
then if you don't do that long

38dbcd8f-7832-42a7-80b4-249b6d81ba62-3
01:22:43.443 --> 01:22:47.595
enough, then they will start
selling parts of your portfolio

38dbcd8f-7832-42a7-80b4-249b6d81ba62-4
01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:51.815
to get your margin down to how
much your capital can actually

38dbcd8f-7832-42a7-80b4-249b6d81ba62-5
01:22:51.815 --> 01:22:52.360
support.

73823826-d634-4aea-a053-c14daef380fd-0
01:23:06.750 --> 01:23:13.334
OK, so we loaded the data, we
got the positions, and then

73823826-d634-4aea-a053-c14daef380fd-1
01:23:13.334 --> 01:23:19.352
we're going to run it through
the calculator. So the

73823826-d634-4aea-a053-c14daef380fd-2
01:23:19.352 --> 01:23:25.936
optimizer, Yep, I get to show
that process here. But what

73823826-d634-4aea-a053-c14daef380fd-3
01:23:25.936 --> 01:23:31.613
would the optimizer it would
come back with? What

73823826-d634-4aea-a053-c14daef380fd-4
01:23:31.613 --> 01:23:33.430
recommendations.

09a3fe71-a706-41ca-91f0-f05d43351217-0
01:23:34.910 --> 01:24:01.120
A set of recommended trades.
What did I just do?

e4d1b7ed-15ba-429b-a0d8-811a11fd961c-0
01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:19.435
All right. Someone can take care
of that for me. I'll get it. No,

e4d1b7ed-15ba-429b-a0d8-811a11fd961c-1
01:24:19.435 --> 01:24:25.600
I can't get out of it now. Come
on. Oh, there it is.

0f1d4b8b-a548-45f7-aad8-444fd2c755c2-0
01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:03.610
I definitely would call it the
optimizer.

077eaef3-5ac2-4e3b-806b-8156028621c5-0
01:25:25.130 --> 01:25:33.539
Talking about persistency when I
load in my position spreadsheet,

077eaef3-5ac2-4e3b-806b-8156028621c5-1
01:25:33.539 --> 01:25:41.821
if I come back tomorrow, is that
still there or is it transient?

077eaef3-5ac2-4e3b-806b-8156028621c5-2
01:25:41.821 --> 01:25:44.370
I would probably be.

96ea7e15-5f8a-4cf9-a169-7d8a1dfcc015-0
01:25:45.670 --> 01:25:49.990
Willing to make that transient
to make the implementation

96ea7e15-5f8a-4cf9-a169-7d8a1dfcc015-1
01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:54.607
easier. I don't know what you
think about that, Mike. Yeah, I

96ea7e15-5f8a-4cf9-a169-7d8a1dfcc015-2
01:25:54.607 --> 01:25:59.076
kind of agree with you. So if
it's transient, you might not

96ea7e15-5f8a-4cf9-a169-7d8a1dfcc015-3
01:25:59.076 --> 01:26:03.843
even need a trainer to log in.
We're gonna want it guarded by a

96ea7e15-5f8a-4cf9-a169-7d8a1dfcc015-4
01:26:03.843 --> 01:26:07.270
login just to keep randoms out
of our system.

637fd8d6-63ba-465c-b17e-1470daa4b4da-0
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:26.960
It's pretty. So to a certain
extent, it's transient anyway.

637fd8d6-63ba-465c-b17e-1470daa4b4da-1
01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.185
Like like your position is
probably going to be different

637fd8d6-63ba-465c-b17e-1470daa4b4da-2
01:26:31.185 --> 01:26:35.556
tomorrow. Yeah, I guess maybe
that's not true of all of our

637fd8d6-63ba-465c-b17e-1470daa4b4da-3
01:26:35.556 --> 01:26:40.218
clients, but is there a need to
see what that was when you made

637fd8d6-63ba-465c-b17e-1470daa4b4da-4
01:26:40.218 --> 01:26:44.443
the trade, see what that
information was, what that trade

637fd8d6-63ba-465c-b17e-1470daa4b4da-5
01:26:44.443 --> 01:26:45.389
was based on?

0a6dfaa4-4d67-4706-af9c-0d7cbf13dddb-0
01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:52.494
Yeah, I mean I think it's, it
would be kind of like a nice to

0a6dfaa4-4d67-4706-af9c-0d7cbf13dddb-1
01:26:52.494 --> 01:26:56.705
have to have some history, but I
don't think the core

0a6dfaa4-4d67-4706-af9c-0d7cbf13dddb-2
01:26:56.705 --> 01:27:01.618
functionality that we definitely
need. OK. So we'll start with

0a6dfaa4-4d67-4706-af9c-0d7cbf13dddb-3
01:27:01.618 --> 01:27:06.531
the transient, but Randy, Scott
Parker, we may need to keep in

0a6dfaa4-4d67-4706-af9c-0d7cbf13dddb-4
01:27:06.531 --> 01:27:11.054
mind that we may need to
preserve it down the road. Yeah.

0a6dfaa4-4d67-4706-af9c-0d7cbf13dddb-5
01:27:11.054 --> 01:27:13.939
So then basically like when you
get.

43718747-aa84-40a9-b2d0-8931361464a2-0
01:27:19.890 --> 01:27:28.787
You have starting positions, you
add recommended trades and then

43718747-aa84-40a9-b2d0-8931361464a2-1
01:27:28.787 --> 01:27:36.864
you get a new position. So
should we put in a something in

43718747-aa84-40a9-b2d0-8931361464a2-2
01:27:36.864 --> 01:27:40.150
the middle here of like?

675d67f1-9e79-4c35-8431-427d2ef2e383-0
01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:56.347
Portfolio calculations. So what
I'm thinking is you can load in

675d67f1-9e79-4c35-8431-427d2ef2e383-1
01:27:56.347 --> 01:28:01.644
your spreadsheet and and you
could run the span calculations,

675d67f1-9e79-4c35-8431-427d2ef2e383-2
01:28:01.644 --> 01:28:06.941
see what the the span number is,
right? Yeah. The way I would

675d67f1-9e79-4c35-8431-427d2ef2e383-3
01:28:06.941 --> 01:28:12.067
think about it is that you have
some kind of positions data

675d67f1-9e79-4c35-8431-427d2ef2e383-4
01:28:12.067 --> 01:28:17.363
structure. You can run your, I
guess like an analysis tool on

675d67f1-9e79-4c35-8431-427d2ef2e383-5
01:28:17.363 --> 01:28:18.559
it which will.

049ee94e-83bf-459d-87e1-66295d599ede-0
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:29.324
Show you sort of more detailed
information than just like the

049ee94e-83bf-459d-87e1-66295d599ede-1
01:28:29.324 --> 01:28:36.564
final number, and then you can
get a position by either loading

049ee94e-83bf-459d-87e1-66295d599ede-2
01:28:36.564 --> 01:28:43.465
it from a clearing from file,
maybe loading it from our sort

049ee94e-83bf-459d-87e1-66295d599ede-3
01:28:43.465 --> 01:28:50.819
of custom template, or starting
with another position and adding

049ee94e-83bf-459d-87e1-66295d599ede-4
01:28:50.819 --> 01:28:52.290
trades to it.

302171ee-6d1e-4cca-8a19-36a58e1bb8aa-0
01:28:57.620 --> 01:29:02.798
So user could enter their own
manual trades. There's yeah,

302171ee-6d1e-4cca-8a19-36a58e1bb8aa-1
01:29:02.798 --> 01:29:08.065
yeah, and then there's the.
Essentially there's there's two

302171ee-6d1e-4cca-8a19-36a58e1bb8aa-2
01:29:08.065 --> 01:29:13.770
operations that can be done on a
on a position. One is calculate

302171ee-6d1e-4cca-8a19-36a58e1bb8aa-3
01:29:13.770 --> 01:29:19.300
recommended trades and the other
is show me, show me analysis.

4ac1c083-06dd-47f9-a061-936953fe33f0-0
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.870
Right.

380da62a-eddd-4b38-b265-5f24679a3971-0
01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:31.883
User entered positions, what the
position being? Well, where if

380da62a-eddd-4b38-b265-5f24679a3971-1
01:30:31.883 --> 01:30:38.911
they increase their position to
something, yeah, I mean it's

380da62a-eddd-4b38-b265-5f24679a3971-2
01:30:38.911 --> 01:30:43.750
it's a little bit arbitrary I
guess like.

8fd26da5-04ac-4c71-a06a-493cbe124082-0
01:30:44.670 --> 01:30:48.975
At the end of the day, the
analysis and the recommendation

8fd26da5-04ac-4c71-a06a-493cbe124082-1
01:30:48.975 --> 01:30:53.718
like algorithms are going to run
on a position regardless of how

8fd26da5-04ac-4c71-a06a-493cbe124082-2
01:30:53.718 --> 01:30:58.388
that position got created. You
can create a position by loading

8fd26da5-04ac-4c71-a06a-493cbe124082-3
01:30:58.388 --> 01:31:02.620
a file or by whatever kind of
tools we want to provide to

8fd26da5-04ac-4c71-a06a-493cbe124082-4
01:31:02.620 --> 01:31:07.144
modify it in the tool. So one of
those would probably just be

8fd26da5-04ac-4c71-a06a-493cbe124082-5
01:31:07.144 --> 01:31:11.669
like a one click add this trade
to my recommended position or

8fd26da5-04ac-4c71-a06a-493cbe124082-6
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:14.149
add this recommended trade to
my.

35630d2d-cb7d-44d1-9797-62cbde433c7c-0
01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:19.128
Position from like the analysis
tool. Another way might be just

35630d2d-cb7d-44d1-9797-62cbde433c7c-1
01:31:19.128 --> 01:31:22.971
a total free form enter trades
system. We could also maybe

35630d2d-cb7d-44d1-9797-62cbde433c7c-2
01:31:22.971 --> 01:31:27.010
build like a, you know, like
more of an edit tool or like you

35630d2d-cb7d-44d1-9797-62cbde433c7c-3
01:31:27.010 --> 01:31:30.787
sort of show the existing
positions and then can like you

35630d2d-cb7d-44d1-9797-62cbde433c7c-4
01:31:30.787 --> 01:31:34.826
know adjust the number of each
line on it or add new lines to

35630d2d-cb7d-44d1-9797-62cbde433c7c-5
01:31:34.826 --> 01:31:38.799
it. But really that's kind of a,
I guess what I would call a

35630d2d-cb7d-44d1-9797-62cbde433c7c-6
01:31:38.799 --> 01:31:42.968
little bit of an implementation
detail as far as how do you get

35630d2d-cb7d-44d1-9797-62cbde433c7c-7
01:31:42.968 --> 01:31:43.879
that position.

ce16522c-744b-4fb4-aa56-a5591544c847-0
01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:51.162
Yeah, how I'm imagining it is,
once those recommended trades,

ce16522c-744b-4fb4-aa56-a5591544c847-1
01:31:51.162 --> 01:31:54.858
once those trades, the
recommended trades are

ce16522c-744b-4fb4-aa56-a5591544c847-2
01:31:54.858 --> 01:31:59.438
recommended, then the user would
be able to go ahead and

ce16522c-744b-4fb4-aa56-a5591544c847-3
01:31:59.438 --> 01:32:04.340
implement that recommendation if
they want. Maybe, as you're

ce16522c-744b-4fb4-aa56-a5591544c847-4
01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:08.357
describing me, making some
changes to it and then

ce16522c-744b-4fb4-aa56-a5591544c847-5
01:32:08.357 --> 01:32:13.340
finalizing it. Yeah, it's not
like a what if scenario, right?

54e964df-1760-401c-ab49-e9db6c9320b9-0
01:32:14.430 --> 01:32:19.104
Yep, that's exactly what it is.
The place I'm trying to

54e964df-1760-401c-ab49-e9db6c9320b9-1
01:32:19.104 --> 01:32:23.945
reconcile my head is the the
disconnect between trade and

54e964df-1760-401c-ab49-e9db6c9320b9-2
01:32:23.945 --> 01:32:28.703
positions. You know, if you
enter a trade on a financial

54e964df-1760-401c-ab49-e9db6c9320b9-3
01:32:28.703 --> 01:32:34.128
instrument that you don't have,
that trade is a position. If you

54e964df-1760-401c-ab49-e9db6c9320b9-4
01:32:34.128 --> 01:32:39.553
enter a trade that increases or
decreases your current position,

54e964df-1760-401c-ab49-e9db6c9320b9-5
01:32:39.553 --> 01:32:43.310
there's some addition
subtractions to go on.

d0babc09-41d7-42df-9671-51332f9c8c35-0
01:32:45.950 --> 01:32:51.132
I think we can figure that out
in our heads. I don't need to

d0babc09-41d7-42df-9671-51332f9c8c35-1
01:32:51.132 --> 01:32:56.569
model that here, but clear that
up at some point. Yeah, there's

d0babc09-41d7-42df-9671-51332f9c8c35-2
01:32:56.569 --> 01:33:01.751
basically like a anything of
positions as an object. There's

d0babc09-41d7-42df-9671-51332f9c8c35-3
01:33:01.751 --> 01:33:07.018
going to be an add trades method
to it that does exactly what

d0babc09-41d7-42df-9671-51332f9c8c35-4
01:33:07.018 --> 01:33:12.370
you're talking about. If it's a
totally new instrument, adds a

d0babc09-41d7-42df-9671-51332f9c8c35-5
01:33:12.370 --> 01:33:12.709
new.

95fb3332-8e74-4200-8f1e-16e35bec4b61-0
01:33:13.190 --> 01:33:18.349
Record sort of line. If it's
modifications to existing then

95fb3332-8e74-4200-8f1e-16e35bec4b61-1
01:33:18.349 --> 01:33:23.766
you modify the quantity of the
existing records. A position is

95fb3332-8e74-4200-8f1e-16e35bec4b61-2
01:33:23.766 --> 01:33:29.355
a collection of trades, is that
no fair to say no, no a position

95fb3332-8e74-4200-8f1e-16e35bec4b61-3
01:33:29.355 --> 01:33:34.256
is, well I guess what I was
gonna say is a position is a

95fb3332-8e74-4200-8f1e-16e35bec4b61-4
01:33:34.256 --> 01:33:39.158
collection of positions, but
that's not very helpful. So

95fb3332-8e74-4200-8f1e-16e35bec4b61-5
01:33:39.158 --> 01:33:40.190
essentially.

071a6ef5-da61-4cce-8827-b3a4789f5c09-0
01:33:41.230 --> 01:33:46.662
A portfolio is a collection of
positions, OK. Yeah. So maybe we

071a6ef5-da61-4cce-8827-b3a4789f5c09-1
01:33:46.662 --> 01:33:51.245
should call it a portfolio.
Yeah. So a portfolio is a

071a6ef5-da61-4cce-8827-b3a4789f5c09-2
01:33:51.245 --> 01:33:55.574
collection of positions. A
position is a financial

071a6ef5-da61-4cce-8827-b3a4789f5c09-3
01:33:55.574 --> 01:34:00.922
instrument and the quantity that
you have on that. And you can

071a6ef5-da61-4cce-8827-b3a4789f5c09-4
01:34:00.922 --> 01:34:06.015
either do that as a signed
quantity or you could do it as a

071a6ef5-da61-4cce-8827-b3a4789f5c09-5
01:34:06.015 --> 01:34:09.750
side and a quantity that's
always positive.

8672686f-7eaf-40ce-9475-96c0e10e849c-0
01:34:13.490 --> 01:34:18.342
I kind of like to do signed
quantities, but it seems like a

8672686f-7eaf-40ce-9475-96c0e10e849c-1
01:34:18.342 --> 01:34:23.114
lot of people in the industry
prefer quantities, always be

8672686f-7eaf-40ce-9475-96c0e10e849c-2
01:34:23.114 --> 01:34:28.209
positive, then have a side to
it. But you get to that quantity

8672686f-7eaf-40ce-9475-96c0e10e849c-3
01:34:28.209 --> 01:34:33.385
through X number of trades over
time, right? Yeah, OK. And then

8672686f-7eaf-40ce-9475-96c0e10e849c-4
01:34:33.385 --> 01:34:38.642
I made a main thing that makes a
trade different from a position

8672686f-7eaf-40ce-9475-96c0e10e849c-5
01:34:38.642 --> 01:34:39.289
is that.

b658c8df-4aec-44e0-9712-7ca09613bd96-0
01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:45.514
A trade has a price at which it
was done. Are you

b658c8df-4aec-44e0-9712-7ca09613bd96-1
01:34:45.514 --> 01:34:52.674
differentiating trade? Because
really it's, it's the leg that

b658c8df-4aec-44e0-9712-7ca09613bd96-2
01:34:52.674 --> 01:34:59.718
you have like in a in a, in a
raw equity market or even bond

b658c8df-4aec-44e0-9712-7ca09613bd96-3
01:34:59.718 --> 01:35:05.954
market, your collection of
trades, your position is a

b658c8df-4aec-44e0-9712-7ca09613bd96-4
01:35:05.954 --> 01:35:08.379
collection of trades.

d1c765cb-2fa7-42e8-a24c-1fbf758db7c4-0
01:35:11.100 --> 01:35:16.131
It's it's not exactly a
collection of trades. The like

d1c765cb-2fa7-42e8-a24c-1fbf758db7c4-1
01:35:16.131 --> 01:35:21.802
the the position is built up
over time by trades, but there's

d1c765cb-2fa7-42e8-a24c-1fbf758db7c4-2
01:35:21.802 --> 01:35:27.565
sort of like an information loss
there, right? Like if you buy

d1c765cb-2fa7-42e8-a24c-1fbf758db7c4-3
01:35:27.565 --> 01:35:32.504
one, buy 2, sell 3, your
position is 0. It's not that

d1c765cb-2fa7-42e8-a24c-1fbf758db7c4-4
01:35:32.504 --> 01:35:34.700
whole history of trades.

1e50b8b7-99a0-4b88-b557-972f7a4f7c4c-0
01:35:46.380 --> 01:35:52.156
I think for our purposes on Day
12 we're OK with positions being

1e50b8b7-99a0-4b88-b557-972f7a4f7c4c-1
01:35:52.156 --> 01:35:57.755
a client of checks for now. We
can get in the nuances a little

1e50b8b7-99a0-4b88-b557-972f7a4f7c4c-2
01:35:57.755 --> 01:36:03.620
bit later. If you actually do it
that way in the code, it's going

1e50b8b7-99a0-4b88-b557-972f7a4f7c4c-3
01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:07.620
to make your implementation
pretty nasty OK.

3dc72c1d-cae4-44e2-b63c-d4e79894e594-0
01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:19.145
Yeah, Kevin, Scott, Scott's
right on this. Oh, I don't doubt

3dc72c1d-cae4-44e2-b63c-d4e79894e594-1
01:36:19.145 --> 01:36:26.118
it. I'm just trying not to. Our
team needs to know it. Our team

3dc72c1d-cae4-44e2-b63c-d4e79894e594-2
01:36:26.118 --> 01:36:32.655
might not need to that right
this minute. So I'm saying OK,

3dc72c1d-cae4-44e2-b63c-d4e79894e594-3
01:36:32.655 --> 01:36:37.340
Plus we need here. Oh, I need to
put some.

fb5daf14-aca7-4a61-8db1-9cf2f8218ead-0
01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:44.510
Notes where we have these
recommended trades, are these

fb5daf14-aca7-4a61-8db1-9cf2f8218ead-1
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:51.271
recommended trades the same ones
that we may want to then turn

fb5daf14-aca7-4a61-8db1-9cf2f8218ead-2
01:36:51.271 --> 01:36:57.925
into hot trades that we have in
the axe binder? Probably not.

fb5daf14-aca7-4a61-8db1-9cf2f8218ead-3
01:36:57.925 --> 01:37:02.540
They're sort of pretty different
purposes.

8ae9ba83-fd7c-4076-939f-c6b16519fc70-0
01:37:07.620 --> 01:37:11.155
I thought they were different
purposes. I just want to make

8ae9ba83-fd7c-4076-939f-c6b16519fc70-1
01:37:11.155 --> 01:37:14.748
sure that we didn't have a need
to tie the two together. You

8ae9ba83-fd7c-4076-939f-c6b16519fc70-2
01:37:14.748 --> 01:37:18.637
don't have the need. But I guess
like in the perfect world, yeah,

8ae9ba83-fd7c-4076-939f-c6b16519fc70-3
01:37:18.637 --> 01:37:22.525
you just have one hot trades and
say, oh, I'm foolish, but I also

8ae9ba83-fd7c-4076-939f-c6b16519fc70-4
01:37:22.525 --> 01:37:26.119
need to get this done by the end
of the day to to, you know,

8ae9ba83-fd7c-4076-939f-c6b16519fc70-5
01:37:26.119 --> 01:37:29.478
close out some of my, My
Portfolio. So they're probably,

8ae9ba83-fd7c-4076-939f-c6b16519fc70-6
01:37:29.478 --> 01:37:33.130
and that might not have been a
good example. I guess what I'm

8ae9ba83-fd7c-4076-939f-c6b16519fc70-7
01:37:33.130 --> 01:37:35.900
really getting at is do we have
a need to tie?

2f074144-9423-4768-95e9-47cc430929d7-0
01:37:36.950 --> 01:37:41.870
The two applications together,
the Act Finder and the margin

2f074144-9423-4768-95e9-47cc430929d7-1
01:37:41.870 --> 01:37:47.032
optimizer together. Or do they
really serve different customers

2f074144-9423-4768-95e9-47cc430929d7-2
01:37:47.032 --> 01:37:51.872
different purposes? They would
serve the same customers but

2f074144-9423-4768-95e9-47cc430929d7-3
01:37:51.872 --> 01:37:56.954
different purposes in like an
ideal world. Long term like like

2f074144-9423-4768-95e9-47cc430929d7-4
01:37:56.954 --> 01:38:02.036
an option on recommended trades
in the margin tool send to hot

2f074144-9423-4768-95e9-47cc430929d7-5
01:38:02.036 --> 01:38:06.150
trades would be like that would
be a good feature.

fcbaf62e-0e2a-4cde-8bf6-689faf09fc49-0
01:38:07.610 --> 01:38:12.460
But I don't think we want to
build it that way initially. The

fcbaf62e-0e2a-4cde-8bf6-689faf09fc49-1
01:38:12.460 --> 01:38:17.311
sort of for technical reasons
based on how the market data is

fcbaf62e-0e2a-4cde-8bf6-689faf09fc49-2
01:38:17.311 --> 01:38:22.005
being done, we're not going to
be able to support arbitrary

fcbaf62e-0e2a-4cde-8bf6-689faf09fc49-3
01:38:22.005 --> 01:38:26.699
trades in the hot trades. It's
going to have to be like us,

fcbaf62e-0e2a-4cde-8bf6-689faf09fc49-4
01:38:26.699 --> 01:38:31.159
like one of our sort of set
canned options, whereas this

fcbaf62e-0e2a-4cde-8bf6-689faf09fc49-5
01:38:31.159 --> 01:38:36.010
this tool is going to be is not
going to constrain itself to.

694508de-5303-4fa5-b739-13cb3fadda98-0
01:38:38.290 --> 01:38:42.890
Like those preset options. So
initially we would want them to

694508de-5303-4fa5-b739-13cb3fadda98-1
01:38:42.890 --> 01:38:47.566
log in and see do I want to go
into xfinder or do I want to go

694508de-5303-4fa5-b739-13cb3fadda98-2
01:38:47.566 --> 01:38:52.167
into margin optimizer and keep
them separated like that but a

694508de-5303-4fa5-b739-13cb3fadda98-3
01:38:52.167 --> 01:38:56.768
single log in? Yeah. Mmhmm. OK.
Sorry, Kevin, keep going. You

694508de-5303-4fa5-b739-13cb3fadda98-4
01:38:56.768 --> 01:39:01.220
were gonna make some notes for
position spreadsheet. Should

694508de-5303-4fa5-b739-13cb3fadda98-5
01:39:01.220 --> 01:39:05.673
this be a portfolio? I mean,
logically it's the same thing,

694508de-5303-4fa5-b739-13cb3fadda98-6
01:39:05.673 --> 01:39:05.969
but.

39862735-6a44-4437-a7bc-47c913726354-0
01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:12.529
You know, if you think of your
marketing material, would you

39862735-6a44-4437-a7bc-47c913726354-1
01:39:12.529 --> 01:39:16.793
tell your users to update,
upload your positions or upload

39862735-6a44-4437-a7bc-47c913726354-2
01:39:16.793 --> 01:39:21.419
your portfolio. So I feel like
in the like the way I've usually

39862735-6a44-4437-a7bc-47c913726354-3
01:39:21.419 --> 01:39:26.045
talked about it in the past, I
would have called it upload your

39862735-6a44-4437-a7bc-47c913726354-4
01:39:26.045 --> 01:39:30.092
positions, but it kind of makes
more sense to call it a

39862735-6a44-4437-a7bc-47c913726354-5
01:39:30.092 --> 01:39:34.429
portfolio just to give different
names to a portfolio and a

39862735-6a44-4437-a7bc-47c913726354-6
01:39:34.429 --> 01:39:35.079
position.

940e53c9-8c71-4b07-90f1-a4319cd0e51e-0
01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:43.443
But I don't know how much we
care about that, but I think

940e53c9-8c71-4b07-90f1-a4319cd0e51e-1
01:39:43.443 --> 01:39:49.062
sort of what we talked about
before, if we make a portfolio,

940e53c9-8c71-4b07-90f1-a4319cd0e51e-2
01:39:49.062 --> 01:39:54.589
a collection of positions, then
you would want to call that

940e53c9-8c71-4b07-90f1-a4319cd0e51e-3
01:39:54.589 --> 01:40:00.485
portfolio. Well what what I was
thinking about was representing

940e53c9-8c71-4b07-90f1-a4319cd0e51e-4
01:40:00.485 --> 01:40:02.420
with physicians here.

2e9adfb8-df5e-4458-a32f-af3e2177ddab-0
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:23.670
What?

94df92ee-994e-4688-9b19-3d5707f39f87-0
01:40:56.470 --> 01:41:01.339
So now work with me for a
second. I was thinking about

94df92ee-994e-4688-9b19-3d5707f39f87-1
01:41:01.339 --> 01:41:06.385
having these are really like
uploaded positions and then

94df92ee-994e-4688-9b19-3d5707f39f87-2
01:41:06.385 --> 01:41:11.521
recommended trades and user
entered trades. Would it make

94df92ee-994e-4688-9b19-3d5707f39f87-3
01:41:11.521 --> 01:41:16.744
sense to put them all at the
same level like this that the

94df92ee-994e-4688-9b19-3d5707f39f87-4
01:41:16.744 --> 01:41:17.630
portfolio?

77274b0a-bbd2-4af8-8c44-924fb3488b85-0
01:41:20.540 --> 01:41:26.368
In fact, that shouldn't even
call it portfolio spreadsheet. I

77274b0a-bbd2-4af8-8c44-924fb3488b85-1
01:41:26.368 --> 01:41:32.008
should call it portfolio. I
think you might want to reverse

77274b0a-bbd2-4af8-8c44-924fb3488b85-2
01:41:32.008 --> 01:41:37.649
the order of portfolio and
positions there because like the

77274b0a-bbd2-4af8-8c44-924fb3488b85-3
01:41:37.649 --> 01:41:43.101
recommended trades in the
analysis are operations done to

77274b0a-bbd2-4af8-8c44-924fb3488b85-4
01:41:43.101 --> 01:41:47.049
a portfolio and then user ended
and then.

e2f5b029-06d3-4f2e-a85c-b4288a496726-0
01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:53.915
Adding trades to a portfolio to
yield a new portfolio is like an

e2f5b029-06d3-4f2e-a85c-b4288a496726-1
01:41:53.915 --> 01:41:58.995
operation you can do and then
sending your recommended trades

e2f5b029-06d3-4f2e-a85c-b4288a496726-2
01:41:58.995 --> 01:42:03.911
into an existing portfolio is
another operation you can do.

e2f5b029-06d3-4f2e-a85c-b4288a496726-3
01:42:03.911 --> 01:42:08.828
Yeah. But we're at this point, I
think we're just doing the

e2f5b029-06d3-4f2e-a85c-b4288a496726-4
01:42:08.828 --> 01:42:13.990
entities, not the actions. OK,
then I I would probably delete.

47704e7e-8dd8-4ef5-ad57-9bd05f51b9d7-0
01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:29.268
Recommended trades and I guess
maybe delete portfolio if we

47704e7e-8dd8-4ef5-ad57-9bd05f51b9d7-1
01:42:29.268 --> 01:42:39.861
just want to talk about it as
collection of positions and then

47704e7e-8dd8-4ef5-ad57-9bd05f51b9d7-2
01:42:39.861 --> 01:42:47.260
maybe we don't even need the
trades either.

55dc2025-e342-44b4-a40d-c6c61672cc8c-0
01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:58.466
It's just a a modification to a
positions, right? But if if we

55dc2025-e342-44b4-a40d-c6c61672cc8c-1
01:42:58.466 --> 01:43:05.834
look at this port Phillip being
a collection of positions and

55dc2025-e342-44b4-a40d-c6c61672cc8c-2
01:43:05.834 --> 01:43:12.488
just working for a second, we
can undo it if we have to

55dc2025-e342-44b4-a40d-c6c61672cc8c-3
01:43:12.488 --> 01:43:17.480
uploaded positions and then we
have that.

e58d56fb-f8a4-4094-b7de-a34266174794-0
01:43:27.410 --> 01:43:35.090
I'm not sure where to put this
right this second, but portfolio

e58d56fb-f8a4-4094-b7de-a34266174794-1
01:43:35.090 --> 01:43:42.410
can contain these three things
and then we do an analysis on

e58d56fb-f8a4-4094-b7de-a34266174794-2
01:43:42.410 --> 01:43:50.210
the portfolio and that analysis
comes back with data, right. And

e58d56fb-f8a4-4094-b7de-a34266174794-3
01:43:50.210 --> 01:43:54.770
that's if we think of like an
object.

fa4d5fba-d527-486a-a1d2-eacf8d6a873b-0
01:43:58.010 --> 01:44:04.866
Well, that that analysis is,
does the portfolio analysis

fa4d5fba-d527-486a-a1d2-eacf8d6a873b-1
01:44:04.866 --> 01:44:12.445
create the recommended trades?
No. I would think about them as

fa4d5fba-d527-486a-a1d2-eacf8d6a873b-2
01:44:12.445 --> 01:44:19.542
two different operations.
They're probably the recommended

fa4d5fba-d527-486a-a1d2-eacf8d6a873b-3
01:44:19.542 --> 01:44:26.880
trades will use the portfolio
analysis under the hood, yeah.

2dd5a736-175a-40ef-b6e0-8ca349faf2be-0
01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:35.180
I'm going to do that with a nice
dotted line here.

cc92316b-8a86-4ca3-ad6c-64d37f6029fe-0
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:18.991
We think, Scott. Sure. I mean I
wouldn't really make recommended

cc92316b-8a86-4ca3-ad6c-64d37f6029fe-1
01:45:18.991 --> 01:45:23.266
trades and user entered trades
different objects or different

cc92316b-8a86-4ca3-ad6c-64d37f6029fe-2
01:45:23.266 --> 01:45:27.471
entities, they did the same
thing really. It's just a matter

cc92316b-8a86-4ca3-ad6c-64d37f6029fe-3
01:45:27.471 --> 01:45:31.884
of how do you build them up. One
is generated programmatically,

cc92316b-8a86-4ca3-ad6c-64d37f6029fe-4
01:45:31.884 --> 01:45:35.952
one is hand entered, yeah,
that's what you're saying, then

cc92316b-8a86-4ca3-ad6c-64d37f6029fe-5
01:45:35.952 --> 01:45:38.710
we can use one of these little
section.

b943ae30-907f-435a-97d2-c0cccf34ad73-0
01:45:40.290 --> 01:45:50.294
The entity, the entity is going
to be the same, Kevin. It's just

b943ae30-907f-435a-97d2-c0cccf34ad73-1
01:45:50.294 --> 01:45:59.838
the action of how we enter it.
I'm totally with you. Can I do

b943ae30-907f-435a-97d2-c0cccf34ad73-2
01:45:59.838 --> 01:46:03.840
align to this? I can ****.

31fd4748-f6df-4fd4-98b8-1b76ee70413f-0
01:46:32.130 --> 01:46:36.434
Better or worse, like the eye
doctor. Yeah, I mean I still

31fd4748-f6df-4fd4-98b8-1b76ee70413f-1
01:46:36.434 --> 01:46:40.520
think you've got, you know,
duplication there, like the

31fd4748-f6df-4fd4-98b8-1b76ee70413f-2
01:46:40.520 --> 01:46:45.044
recommended trades. And these
are entered trades. They're not

31fd4748-f6df-4fd4-98b8-1b76ee70413f-3
01:46:45.044 --> 01:46:49.641
different entities, they're just
different methods for popular

31fd4748-f6df-4fd4-98b8-1b76ee70413f-4
01:46:49.641 --> 01:46:53.727
for creating an entity and
upload positions really to a

31fd4748-f6df-4fd4-98b8-1b76ee70413f-5
01:46:53.727 --> 01:46:55.770
certain extent the same way.

6e92cc2a-0115-43af-8216-8ef78836a464-0
01:47:01.130 --> 01:47:04.749
Like, let's just take, you know,
take a file, turn it into a

6e92cc2a-0115-43af-8216-8ef78836a464-1
01:47:04.749 --> 01:47:08.250
portfolio. Yeah, I'm, I'm
agreeing what you're saying. I'm

6e92cc2a-0115-43af-8216-8ef78836a464-2
01:47:08.250 --> 01:47:12.047
trying to represent it well. But
like, operations aren't really

6e92cc2a-0115-43af-8216-8ef78836a464-3
01:47:12.047 --> 01:47:15.845
supposed to be on this, right?
Right. That's correct. It should

6e92cc2a-0115-43af-8216-8ef78836a464-4
01:47:15.845 --> 01:47:19.464
just be entities. That's why I'm
having a hard time with the

6e92cc2a-0115-43af-8216-8ef78836a464-5
01:47:19.464 --> 01:47:23.143
portfolio analysis too. So I
know, as Scott said a while ago,

6e92cc2a-0115-43af-8216-8ef78836a464-6
01:47:23.143 --> 01:47:27.000
there's two things you can do on
a portfolio, right? You can see

6e92cc2a-0115-43af-8216-8ef78836a464-7
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:29.730
recommended trades. You can see
the analysis.

9396f798-d7fa-4524-a35d-046d3a3f18da-0
01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:35.882
It's definitely sound like use
cases, but I I do still feel

9396f798-d7fa-4524-a35d-046d3a3f18da-1
01:47:35.882 --> 01:47:41.205
like we need some kind of
representation of a trade here

9396f798-d7fa-4524-a35d-046d3a3f18da-2
01:47:41.205 --> 01:47:46.808
as an entity and just whatever
type of trade is that can be

9396f798-d7fa-4524-a35d-046d3a3f18da-3
01:47:46.808 --> 01:47:52.224
that's can be defined later,
well then it really would be

9396f798-d7fa-4524-a35d-046d3a3f18da-4
01:47:52.224 --> 01:47:56.520
positions and then these two
kind of go away.

7b1e7a21-a8ef-480f-a175-bc7625bab61b-0
01:47:59.470 --> 01:48:06.759
Don't you still need one of
them? Well, these are

7b1e7a21-a8ef-480f-a175-bc7625bab61b-1
01:48:06.759 --> 01:48:15.798
effectively positions and so I
mean if we want to jury rigs a

7b1e7a21-a8ef-480f-a175-bc7625bab61b-2
01:48:15.798 --> 01:48:24.254
little bit, I mean like we
could, we could, we could make

7b1e7a21-a8ef-480f-a175-bc7625bab61b-3
01:48:24.254 --> 01:48:26.150
it like that.

f4b2df94-d5a6-4f37-886b-cad4c14b53cd-0
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:36.052
I don't know, that's just that
seems like cheating. I guess

f4b2df94-d5a6-4f37-886b-cad4c14b53cd-1
01:48:36.052 --> 01:48:43.556
I'm, I'm still not completely
understanding why we don't just

f4b2df94-d5a6-4f37-886b-cad4c14b53cd-2
01:48:43.556 --> 01:48:50.940
have portfolio and trades or
maybe positions and or position

f4b2df94-d5a6-4f37-886b-cad4c14b53cd-3
01:48:50.940 --> 01:48:57.839
and trade because we don't need,
we don't need different

f4b2df94-d5a6-4f37-886b-cad4c14b53cd-4
01:48:57.839 --> 01:49:05.343
different entities for a thing
and a collection of the thing,

f4b2df94-d5a6-4f37-886b-cad4c14b53cd-5
01:49:05.343 --> 01:49:06.070
right?

d4670a66-3a50-4543-b346-8f8ab9e7ccda-0
01:49:07.070 --> 01:49:13.032
Do we, so you're saying a
portfolio just being a is is

d4670a66-3a50-4543-b346-8f8ab9e7ccda-1
01:49:13.032 --> 01:49:19.646
almost like a it should, it's a
virtual construct. Yeah, you

d4670a66-3a50-4543-b346-8f8ab9e7ccda-2
01:49:19.646 --> 01:49:25.392
mentioned earlier about
positions as a collection of

d4670a66-3a50-4543-b346-8f8ab9e7ccda-3
01:49:25.392 --> 01:49:31.463
positions which sounded
redundant, but that sounds like

d4670a66-3a50-4543-b346-8f8ab9e7ccda-4
01:49:31.463 --> 01:49:35.800
what we're getting back to
almost here.

548a11ff-5ed7-4c05-94e9-651f08b7bcda-0
01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:57.226
So Scotty thinking that really
they're uploading positions and

548a11ff-5ed7-4c05-94e9-651f08b7bcda-1
01:49:57.226 --> 01:50:08.600
then you could we could also say
that a trader manly enters.

ea2489e6-7e85-469e-a58c-40277fccc135-0
01:50:14.790 --> 01:50:22.840
Yeah. And then portfolio
analysis informs recommends,

ea2489e6-7e85-469e-a58c-40277fccc135-1
01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:31.637
yeah, I kind of like that. We
want to talk about portfolio

ea2489e6-7e85-469e-a58c-40277fccc135-2
01:50:31.637 --> 01:50:40.433
analysis a little bit. So it's
it's not just an operation,

ea2489e6-7e85-469e-a58c-40277fccc135-3
01:50:40.433 --> 01:50:42.669
there's like a.

e26a15f3-421c-4780-8d24-fdaf7179f4d4-0
01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:58.316
Like a data set almost, but like
it would be things like a list

e26a15f3-421c-4780-8d24-fdaf7179f4d4-1
01:50:58.316 --> 01:51:11.052
of your products sorted by
impact on margin. A list of all

e26a15f3-421c-4780-8d24-fdaf7179f4d4-2
01:51:11.052 --> 01:51:12.780
of your.

9ed8cbca-c920-4186-b5c1-117f0b8cc540-0
01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:20.435
Positions with a like indication
of how much of your margin is

9ed8cbca-c920-4186-b5c1-117f0b8cc540-1
01:51:20.435 --> 01:51:26.291
being caused by that position be
a breakdown of which which of

9ed8cbca-c920-4186-b5c1-117f0b8cc540-2
01:51:26.291 --> 01:51:32.425
your spreads are offsetting your
sort of basic margin anyway like

9ed8cbca-c920-4186-b5c1-117f0b8cc540-3
01:51:32.425 --> 01:51:38.374
getting into the details of what
exactly the portfolio analysis

9ed8cbca-c920-4186-b5c1-117f0b8cc540-4
01:51:38.374 --> 01:51:40.139
is is going to get.

7c601bbc-41ed-4dcf-b4e6-443668d22e51-0
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:45.093
Like take us way into the weeds
of what is span and how is it

7c601bbc-41ed-4dcf-b4e6-443668d22e51-1
01:51:45.093 --> 01:51:49.326
calculated. But you basically
think about it as like the the

7c601bbc-41ed-4dcf-b4e6-443668d22e51-2
01:51:49.326 --> 01:51:52.727
results of intermediate
calculations in the span

7c601bbc-41ed-4dcf-b4e6-443668d22e51-3
01:51:52.727 --> 01:51:57.099
calculation process. That sort
of help you understand how it's

7c601bbc-41ed-4dcf-b4e6-443668d22e51-4
01:51:57.099 --> 01:52:01.402
happening and you know how you
would be able to change it. So

7c601bbc-41ed-4dcf-b4e6-443668d22e51-5
01:52:01.402 --> 01:52:04.803
it does have like a a
manifestation as like a an

7c601bbc-41ed-4dcf-b4e6-443668d22e51-6
01:52:04.803 --> 01:52:08.690
object or a collection of
objects that would show up in

7c601bbc-41ed-4dcf-b4e6-443668d22e51-7
01:52:08.690 --> 01:52:09.870
your application.

36f7fe5b-d3f4-4ce9-bc02-f6e479dadaec-0
01:52:11.470 --> 01:52:16.021
And it's pretty complicated.
It's just not. But it's not just

36f7fe5b-d3f4-4ce9-bc02-f6e479dadaec-1
01:52:16.021 --> 01:52:20.572
an operation. It really does
have it. It's like the output of

36f7fe5b-d3f4-4ce9-bc02-f6e479dadaec-2
01:52:20.572 --> 01:52:25.270
the analysis process is going to
be an entity with those from a

36f7fe5b-d3f4-4ce9-bc02-f6e479dadaec-3
01:52:25.270 --> 01:52:29.895
simplistic standpoint with those
with the output be attributes

36f7fe5b-d3f4-4ce9-bc02-f6e479dadaec-4
01:52:29.895 --> 01:52:34.520
for each position. Or does it
also do like correlations across

36f7fe5b-d3f4-4ce9-bc02-f6e479dadaec-5
01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:37.749
positions? It's really, really
complicated.

61bcd863-b841-4292-aba2-4c3d5869fa29-0
01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:47.795
Like hundreds of pages of PDF's,
complicated, okay, I don't want

61bcd863-b841-4292-aba2-4c3d5869fa29-1
01:52:47.795 --> 01:52:53.816
to cut anybody off, but we are a
minute over time. I want to

61bcd863-b841-4292-aba2-4c3d5869fa29-2
01:52:53.816 --> 01:52:59.443
respect everybody's time. So I
think we made really good

61bcd863-b841-4292-aba2-4c3d5869fa29-3
01:52:59.443 --> 01:53:05.167
progress and probably need to
spend more time in the next

61bcd863-b841-4292-aba2-4c3d5869fa29-4
01:53:05.167 --> 01:53:08.820
session getting through the rest
of.

3804aaa8-b64b-4cf8-8608-d2842390e8d3-0
01:53:09.540 --> 01:53:12.414
The rest of the apps. So I think
we'll plan on repurposing

3804aaa8-b64b-4cf8-8608-d2842390e8d3-1
01:53:12.414 --> 01:53:15.436
probably the next one, but we'll
put some thought into it and

3804aaa8-b64b-4cf8-8608-d2842390e8d3-2
01:53:15.436 --> 01:53:18.116
I'll send something out to
everybody just so everybody

3804aaa8-b64b-4cf8-8608-d2842390e8d3-3
01:53:18.116 --> 01:53:20.942
knows what to expect on the next
session. I think it's on

3804aaa8-b64b-4cf8-8608-d2842390e8d3-4
01:53:20.942 --> 01:53:23.866
Wednesday as well, all right.
Yeah Andrew, I think, I think

3804aaa8-b64b-4cf8-8608-d2842390e8d3-5
01:53:23.866 --> 01:53:27.033
we're, I mean even though we're
not fully completely with margin

3804aaa8-b64b-4cf8-8608-d2842390e8d3-6
01:53:27.033 --> 01:53:30.005
optimizer, I think we're, you
know we have a good ideas what

3804aaa8-b64b-4cf8-8608-d2842390e8d3-7
01:53:30.005 --> 01:53:33.027
that is. I think we actually are
done, we are done. OK, good.

3804aaa8-b64b-4cf8-8608-d2842390e8d3-8
01:53:33.027 --> 01:53:36.243
Yeah. And then acts Finder seems
sort of thing I think that we do

3804aaa8-b64b-4cf8-8608-d2842390e8d3-9
01:53:36.243 --> 01:53:37.900
a decent job on that. I mean I
I.

ac1064d1-bab7-4d03-b800-1693441d267b-0
01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:43.283
If I can envision in my habit
what it is, I think we're in

ac1064d1-bab7-4d03-b800-1693441d267b-1
01:53:43.283 --> 01:53:48.207
good shape. So. So we probably
just work on risk manager and

ac1064d1-bab7-4d03-b800-1693441d267b-2
01:53:48.207 --> 01:53:53.132
then VPN afterwards. Yep. I
agree. OK, excellent. We'll pick

ac1064d1-bab7-4d03-b800-1693441d267b-3
01:53:53.132 --> 01:53:57.653
those up next time. Cool. All
right. Thank you. Thanks.

ac1064d1-bab7-4d03-b800-1693441d267b-4
01:53:57.653 --> 01:54:00.559
Thanks, everybody. See you.
Thanks.
