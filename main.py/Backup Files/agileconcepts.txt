The Kingsmen Way
The Kingsmen Way enables our teams to grow quality software and deliver in an iterative manner, crafting a solution that works best for our customers. Instrumental in this is the refinement, product management and business analysis that leads to the solution. We start with a customer's vision and elaborate additional levels of detail until we understand enough to complete daily tasks.

Kingsmen Way
Fundamentals
Kingsmen Software has been built on our ability to Set and Meet expectations
To set and meet expectations we need to be experts at Knowing the work (input) and Knowing our team (output)
Being experts requires the whole team to have an in-depth understanding of our client’s business and technology
Knowing the work requires us to have a repeatable methodology that allows us to build and communicate team knowledge
Knowing our team requires us to have a repeatable methodology that allows us to plan, track and measure team work
